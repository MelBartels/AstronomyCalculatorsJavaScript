Instead, it must be thoroughly integrated into the process of making mirror and telescope. For example, astigmatism cannot be tested for then removed after the fact; instead, controlling astigmatism must be integrated into mirror making by adopting a process that precludes astigmatism from ever forming. A mirror surface cannot be made smooth after the parabolizing is roughed in; instead, the mirror's surface must be made smooth and kept smooth by the mirror parabolizing process. Proper collimation that is added later by adjustments will only come undone over time. Instead, I create good alignment by building it 'right' the first time. To wit, there are no adjustments in my diagonal holder; instead, it is made and assembled aligned. Smooth high power motion near the zenith is built into the telescope by inventing a three-axis double flex-rocker mount. Quality is integrated into my mirror making and telescope designing and building process.";
