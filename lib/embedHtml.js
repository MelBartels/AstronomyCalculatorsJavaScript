Instead, it must be thoroughly integrated into the process of making mirror and telescope. Astigmatism cannot be tested for then removed after the fact; instead mirror makers must adopt a process that precludes astigmatism. A mirror surface cannot be made smooth after parabolizing; instead, the mirror's surface must start smooth and kept smooth by the parabolizing process. Proper collimation that is added later by adjustments will only come undone over time. Instead, I create good alignment by building it 'right' the first time - there are no adjustments in my diagonal holder. Smooth high power motion near the zenith is built into the telescope by inventing a three-axis double flex-rocker mount. Quality is integrated into my mirror making and telescope designing and building process.";
