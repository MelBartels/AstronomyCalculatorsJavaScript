    <h4>Paste your mirror's Ronchigram into this browser page then match the bands. You may have to first open the image in a program then copy from there.</h4>
    <p>By matching the mirror's actual Ronchigram with the computed Ronchigram, the mirror's smoothness and overall correction can be evaluated. The sensitivity of this test is surprisingly high: I'ved parabolized 6" f2.8, 10.5" f2.7 and 25" f2.6 mirrors using the Ronchi Matching Test in conjunction with the Star Test to adjust the diagonal breakout. All these mirrors passing the critical star test with sensibly identical out of focus star disks and diagonal breakout distances. And this test is quick: take a Ronchigram with the phone, copy and paste the image to this webpage, adjust the grating offset along with any image parameters, then inspect for high and low zones to determine next parabolizing work session.</p>

    <h4>Discussion</h4>

    <p>
        Moving inside the radius of curvature is a negative offset; outside the radius of curvature is a positive offset. Inside of the radius of curvature, the bands bow outward as you center your attention to the middle of the mirror. Outside of the radius of curvature, the bands bow outward as you move your eye towards the edge of the mirror. I have included the option of overlaying quarter wavefront under and overcorrection, and I have added an optional fourth Ronchigram where you can common defects like under and over correction and a low or high 70% zone, all set to quarter wavefront deviation (maximum 1/4 wave peak to valley on the wavefront). This comparison Ronchigram uses the third and last grating offset.
	<p>
		 It is important to accurately measure the clear diameter of the mirror, i.e., the reflective diameter, not the outside diameter, and to accurately measure the Radius of Curvature. The accuracy of the computed Ronchi bands is proportional to the mirror's clear diameter to the 4th power divided by the RoC cubed. So accurately measuring the mirror diameter and RoC is important.
    </p>		 

    <h4>About the Ronchi test</h4>

    <p>
        The Ronchi test, discovered by Vasco Ronchi in 1923, is one of the most versatile and easy to use tests. It is an interferometer that can be used geometrically. There is a large body of literature about the Ronchi test. For a review, see Malacara's, "Optical Shop Testing", second edition, chapter 9, &#8216;Ronchi Test'. I use the test geometrically which measures the transverse aberration (the Foucault test measures longitudinal aberration). The Ronchi test excels at measuring a wide range of surfaces from spherical to aspherical (non-spherical) surfaces such as the paraboloid.
    <p>
        There are a number of variants of the Ronchi test including the Mosby, the Null Ronchi, the Ronchi Star Test, the Concentric Grid Ronchi, the Phase Shifting Ronchi Test, the Sideband Ronchi Test, the Lower Test, and the Ronchi Hartmann and Null Hartmann Tests. I'm convinced that there are variations on the Ronchi Test waiting to be discovered and characterized. Inventive amateurs have suggested variants that I hope to try in the future.
    <p>
        I've successfully figured dozens of superb mirrors over many years using the Ronchi Test with notable examples being 30 inch F4, 20 inch F5, 13 inch F3.0, 10.5 inch F2.7 and 6 inch F2.8 mirrors and led mirror making classes using the Ronchi as the principal test. I had a 6 inch F4 checked with the Hartman test. The results were that the surface was 1/20 wave peak to valley and the RMS was 1/60 wave (the defect that the Hartmann test revealed, a broad high centered on the 50% zone, was also seen in the Ronchi test, but I judged it not worth continuing to figure).

	<h4>How good should I make my mirror?</h4>

    <p>
		I make my mirrors as good as I can. As an amateur I spend as much as I like on a mirror. I am also keen to improve my mirror making technique. Finally errors that remain are likely to be worse than I think: all the more reason to try removing them.
    <p>
		During initial figuring, I follow time honored processes, using the quick and sensitive Matching Ronchi test to adjust the process, i.e., bring more polishing action to bear on the mirror’s center if it is lagging behind. My process combats astigmatism, generates a smooth surface and resists edge defects. During final figuring, I begin an iterative process as follow:
	<ol>
		<li>Formulate a figuring action
		<li>Execute the action for 20 seconds to two minutes, the minimum time for a detectable change in the mirror’s figure
		<li>Quickly test to see if the mirror’s figure is changing in the desired direction
		<li>If so then continue on with the figuring action to its conclusion; if not return to step #1
		<li>Return to step #1
	</ol>
    <p>
		I need a test with exquisite sensitivity that I can execute quickly while the mirror finishes drying on the mirror test stand after the figuring spell. That test is my Matching Ronchi test. Its sensitivity is extraordinary as demonstrated in the examples below. And the test takes but a moment to execute. I evaluate by looking through the grating since the mirror’s previous Ronchigram is in my head. For more critical examination, I snap a Ronchigram with my smartphone and copy into my Matching Ronchi webclient run software. I can quickly ascertain which zones need more polishing and which zones should avoid further polish.
    <p>
		The mirror test works in concert with the mirror making process. Since I make my mirrors as good as I can, I concentrate on deviations from the ideal paraboloid, not worrying about a deviation’s hard numerical value, which would be the case if I were making the mirror to an arbitrary rating, saying 1/8 wavefront or 0.96 Strehl.
    <p>
		As I develop my process, the mirror test comes to test not only the mirror, but the process itself. Master opticians count on their process to suppress errors like astigmatism. The best of the masters can parabolize a mirror using a well controlled process without hardly bothering to test until the end. Zambuto’s process using a Mirror-O-Matic machine comes close to generating a properly parabolized mirror simply by following the steps outlined in his spreadsheet. Texereau states that his “group has parabolized a number of mirrors ‘automatically,’ in effect, by using a team of four or five operators all applying the ‘same’ stroke.”
    <p>
		The Matching Ronchi test is very sensitive to zonal errors, to the quality of the overall paraboloidal curve, and to turned edges. It is less sensitive to astigmatism. The test, as with all tests, calls for very accurate Radius of Curvature and clear mirror diameter numbers. I use the star test, which needs no such numbers, to verify that the mirror is perfectly corrected: not over and not under.  I also use the star test to judge the severity of any remaining zones that I am unable to correct.
    <p>
		My mirror making process of mirror on top of full-sized or over-sized lap cures astigmatism, therefore I do not need to constantly test for ‘stig. As a final backstop, I use the star test to look for traces of ‘stig; the star test being very sensitive to small amounts of ‘stig.
    <p>
		The better the mirror maker, the better the process and the more the process can be counted to preclude mirror defects and deliver a good mirror. The zonal Foucault test used with a good process that prohibits astigmatism has been used for centuries by top pros and amateurs to make unimpeachable mirrors. Neophyte mirror makers struggle with testing, figuring and process. The best they can do is obtain the help of a master mirror maker in order to establish a process. The worst they can do is to thrash about, without process, trying wild disjointed ideas.
    <p>
		The Matching Ronchi can be used to quantify mirrors too. Recently a professional optician sent me a Ronchigram of a commercially made 12.5 inch F5 mirror. It was woefully undercorrected. Using the ‘simulate an error’ portion of my Matching Ronchi software, both he and I determined that the mirror was 0.5 waves on the wavefront undercorrected: not 0.4 and not 0.6. My friend used a high end Zygo Interferometer at work to determine that the mirror was undercorrected by 0.48 waves – a very good match.
    <p>
		If I were a professional needing to finish mirrors with very tight timelines in order to meet schedule and be profitable, I would use a different set of tests. I could easily see myself using the Ronchi for smoothness and the Foucault to judge against a numerical standard. I’d use the Bath Interferometer or Unmasked Foucault to verify my use of the Foucault. The point being that the test is integral with the process in creating a fine performing primary mirror. People who post Ronchigrams or Foucault measurements or even Bath Interferometric results should not only state how they reduced their numbers but also explain their mirror making process.

    <h4>Dr. Sherman Schultz</h4>

    <p>
        One of the most successful practitioners was Dr. Sherman Schultz of Macalester College in St Paul Minnesota. He used the Ronchi test in his mirror making classes with countless students successfully completing their telescopes. <a href='http://digitalcommons.macalester.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&context=physics_oralhist'>
        Here's an interview with Dr Schultz.</a> See Telescope Making #9 for an article by Dr Schultz on the Ronchi test.
    <p>
        He lists the following advantages of the Ronchi test.
    <ol>
        <li>Ease of interpretation. Leads to confidence which leads to a better mirror surface. Getting mired down in numbers, spreadsheets and equipment adjustments just isn't confidence inspiring.</li>
        <li>His students made 275 mirrors. Not a single student gave up or quit. Testing can be the point of failure for telescope makers. But not with the Ronchi test.</li>
        <li>The Ronchi test is sensitive enough to distinguish between excellent, good, fair and poor. Every little irregularity is seen. It doesn't matter if the error is 1/6 or 1/8 wave - you don't need to know the magnitude of the error. A drowning person doesn't need to know how deep the water is once he is in over his head. He just needs to know how to swim.</li>
        <li>You work until the curves match. The curves are not a mysterious table of numbers or a grid of coefficients. You can see the perfect simulated curve; remember it in your mind's eye. Each mirror diameter and focal length combination has its own curves (and for that matter, its own set of Foucault zonal measurements).</li>
        <li>You can easily detect, better than any other test, the most common issue, that of turned edge. And the next most common issue, zonal roughness.</li>
        <li>The student immediately recognizes the overall curve as compared to the sphere. The correct corrective action is quickly devised. There is no plotting of the mirror profile as reconstituted from zonal measurements, which by the way, misses issues between the arbitrarily designated zones.</li>
        <li>The test image is bright. The Ronchi test can be used in an ordinarily lit room in daytime. It's easy to setup, easy to see, easy to understand.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Dennis Rech's comments, inventor of the Mirror-O-Matic mirror grinding machine</h4>
	
    <p>
        'When someone asks me to look at their mirror, I have them send me the parameters of the mirror and then I use a Ronchi program to show them what the Ronchi pattern should look like. We then print out the pattern on my big printer at exact scale and tape it to the back of the mirror. We then trace the Ronchi lines onto the front of the mirror with a Sharpie and then test it. And then, within seconds they can see exactly what their mirror should look like compared to what it actually is.<br>
        A spherical mirror shows straight lines and as the center is lowered towards a parabola, the lines bow outwards. The deeper the curve, the more the lines bow. When the bowed Ronchi lines exactly meet the Sharpie lines, we have a parabola. Lines not bowed enough, rub a little more.   Lines too bowed, rub everything else a little more. Lines all wonkie, rub only the zones with flat lines or go back and correct the sphere.<br>
        It is fast, it is accurate and one sees the entire mirror surface, not just a line of a  couple of zones across the mirror. When Carl Zambuto first tried machine fabrication, he commented on the wonderful figure of revolution that comes from using a machine vs, hand work. The Ronchi test shows this immediately, Foucault does not.'

    <h4>General comments</h4>

    <p>
        The Ronchi test is the most effective test when the most important question to answer quickly after each figuring spell is, 'Is it better or worse? Do I continue or change?' See my <a href='mirlog.html'>20 inch mirror log</a> for an example of how to use the Ronchi test. The test is particularly useful in mirror making classes where the mirrors come off of short figuring spells and must be tested quickly lest a bottleneck builds. It's common to have several mirrors waiting to be tested at any one time.
    <p>
        The Ronchi test reveals extremely small changes in the mirror's figure such as zones and differences in correction from one part of the mirror to the other. With care, I have observed defects down to 1/30 wave as judged from other tests like the Caustic and interferometer. Turned edges and overall smoothness are straightforward to detect.
    <p>
        One approach measures the separation between Ronchigrams where the inner Ronchigram shows the central bands separated by a precise amount, say 1 inch or 2.5cm, and the outer Ronchigram shows the edge bands separated by the exact same amount. The separation between Ronchigrams should equal r^2/2R (mirror radius squared divided by twice the radius of curvature). This can be used to gain a sense of overall correction. This can also be extended to intermediate zones.
    <p>
        For best use of the test, compare multiple Ronchigrams over a series of offsets from the radius of curvature. Use a sliding platform with a threaded rod or similar so that you can precisely move the Ronchi tester distances. I use a music stand for quick zeroing in of the Ronchi tester.
    <p>
        Fewer bands are more discriminating. For example, inside radius of curvature expands the bands across the mirror's face, and are more sensitive to errors in the mirror's central zones.<br>
        <img src='JoyOfMirrorMaking/10.5 inch final Ronchigram inside RoC.jpg' class='smallImage'><br>
        Outside radius of curvature expands the bands at the mirror's edge and are more sensitive to errors in the mirror's outer zones.<br>
        <img src='JoyOfMirrorMaking/10.5 inch final Ronchigram outside RoC.jpg' class='smallImage'>
    <p>
        The three levels of comparisons are:<br>
        <ol>
            <li>
                A quick comparison reveals the overall shape and gross errors of the mirror's surface, e.g., is it an oblate spheroid, a paraboloid or a turned edge.
            </li>
            <li>
                A careful side by side comparison reveals zonal errors, i.e., zones of the mirror that are a little high (underparabolized) or a little low (overparabolized).
            </li>
            <li>
                Layering the actual Ronchigram with the theoretical Ronchigram reveals subtle errors.
            </li>
        </ol>
        Here's a quick comparison image showing a turned down edge in a 6 inch [15cm] F2.8 that's being returned to spherical after the initial parabolization attempt:<br>
        <img src='JoyOfMirrorMaking/6 inch session q.jpg' class='smallImage'><br>
        Here's a careful side by side comparison revealing a low (overparabolized) 70% zone in a 6 inch [15cm] F2.8 in the midst of parabolizing:<br>
        <img src='JoyOfMirrorMaking/6 inch session l 1.jpg' class='smallImage'>
        <img src='JoyOfMirrorMaking/6 inch target Ronchigram inside RoC.jpg' class='smallImage'><br>
        Here's a set of images that overlay the actual Ronchigram with theoretical Ronchigram of a finished 10.5 inch [27cm] F2.7 where the high power star test is essentially perfect - the outer 15% is very slightly overcorrected and the inner 85% is very slightly undercorrected (you can see the outer zone's extra curvature):<br>
        <img src='JoyOfMirrorMaking/10.5 inch overlay with computer generated Ronchigram inside RoC.jpg' class='smallImage'>
        <img src='JoyOfMirrorMaking/10.5 inch overlay with computer generated Ronchigram outside RoC.jpg' class='smallImage'><br>
        A criticism sometimes voiced is that the Ronchi test is insensitive because the band's curvature can look very similar for a whole series of situations. For instance, a 10 inch [25cm] F5, fully parabolized at 0.3 inch outside radius of curvature (left image) will look very similar to the bands when a quarter wavefront undercorrected at 0.285 inch outside radius of curvature (right image).<br>
        <img src='JoyOfMirrorMaking/10 inch f5 perfect correction 0.3 offset.png' class='smallImage'>
        <img src='JoyOfMirrorMaking/10 inch f5 quarterwave undercorrected 0.285 offset.png' class='smallImage'><br>
        But overlaying the images and inverting one of them shows a clear difference at the mirror's edge where the outside of radius of curvature offset is most sensitive:<br>
        <img src='JoyOfMirrorMaking/10 inch f5 perfect and quarter wave undercorrected overlay.jpg' class='smallImage'><br>
        Regardless of the offset from radius of curvature of either the theoretical Ronchigram or the actual Ronchigram, the closest matching images will reveal the undercorrection. This is similar to focusing where the discriminating visual observer will select the best compromise focus, e.g., when undercorrected, the focus will be just outside the mirror's outer zone and just inside the mirror's central zone.
    <p>
        What must be known precisely is the mirror's polished diameter (inside of the bevel) and the mirror's radius of curvature. The radius of curvature can be found by positioning the grating so that it matches the computer generated theoretical Ronchigram at zero offset. Measure from the mirror's center to the ruled side of the grating.

        How tightly must we judge the curved Ronchi bands? Perhaps surprisingly, paraboloidal accuracy is solely dependent on focal ratio (mirror size does not matter at all). This is also an indication of the difficult of faster focal ratios where an F4 is twice as demanding as an F8. The graph is for worse case 1/4 wavefront; for the more demanding 1/8 wavefront, halve these values. While slower focal ratios have a larger allowable parabolic deviation percentage, because the paraboloidal correction is smaller, the deviation in absolute terms is also smaller. I've added the capability to see the maximum allowed under and over correction impact on the bands. Select 'zero correction at edge' to best see center band changes and select 'zero correction at center' to best see edge band changes. The conclusion is that regardless of mirror diameter and focal ratio, the shape and curve of each band must be judged critically from top to bottom.<br>

        I derived this relationship by using a standard algorithm that calculates wave error given a set of zonal readings. I iteratively fed it zonal readings smoothly varying by a correction factor, deriving the maximum correction factor that fit the quarter wavefront error envelope. For more, see the comments, code and unit tests in <a href='' 'lib/ronchi.js'>lib/Ronchi.js</a> and <a href='' 'lib/calclib unittests.htm'>calcLib unitTests.htm</a>.
    <p>
        You can see that zonal errors are easy to detect. Using a 16' [41cm] F5 mirror, compare a high 70% zone (sometimes seen in commercial optics) on the left to perfectly parabolized in the middle to a low 70% zone (a common malady when figuring large fast mirrors) on the right. Note how the bands curve too sharply in the low 70% zone image, particularly at the 70% zone, and in the high 70% zone image do not exhibit enough curvature, looking too flat at the 70% zone. Additionally, the center looks too flat in the low 70% zone and the center looks too curved in the high 70% zone Ronchigrams.<br>

        Especially compare the outermost zone when outside the Radius of Curvature, for example...<br>

        I like a grating of about 100 lines per inch [4 lines per millimeter]. It gives enough sensitivity without being overwhelmed with diffraction effects on large fast mirrors. A spherical mirror returns light emanating from the radius of curvature to its origin. The radius of curvature is twice the focal length, the focal length is the mirror diameter times the focal ratio. Light coming from astronomical objects is essentially parallel. This light requires the mirror surface to be shaped in the form of a paraboloid in order to bring the reflected light to perfect focus. A paraboloid compared to a sphere has an ever so slightly deeper center and edge. The result is that the light is deformed as it returns from the mirror and passes through the grating to the eye. This deformation is what we judge, comparing the mirror's Ronchi bands to a computer generated series of Ronchigrams.
    <p>
        The Ronchi test can also be used far away from the radius of curvature. Here, any kinks in the bands will show as ragged bands or inteference effects. The first example shows rough zones towards the edge; the second example shows smooth bands.<br>

	<h4>Diffraction effects</h4>

	<p>
		In some situations diffraction effects can be annoying, even obscuring results. You can<br>
		<ul>
			<li>Find a grating that suppresses the diffraction effects</li>
			<li>Use the grating at a Talbot position</li>
			<li>Study the diffraction pattern itself, which can reveal subtle zones</li>
		</ul>

    <h4>The Ronchi test at the focuser</h4>

    <p>
        The Ronchi test can be used at the telescope's focus. As such it measures the entire optical system including all optics, thermal issues and seeing conditions. This test is commonly thought to be rather crude, in that any deviation from straight bands means a significant error. Used casually such a test ferrets out poor quality mirrors that have trouble with critical high magnification planetary and lunar viewing. At focus the test is half as sensitive as at the radius of curvature or at focus with an auto-collimating flat in the shop. But under the hypothesis that it is the optician that makes the mirror, not the test, can the Ronchi test at focus be used more critically?
    <p>
        It is possible to extract critical information using a quality grating of greater than 100 lines per inch (lpi) [4 lines per millimeter] under good seeing conditions and thermally stabilized optics if the grating is slowly racked back and forth focus where one to three bands cross the illuminated disc. It is critical that the tester have experience judging how the Ronchi bands change dynamically. With care defects to 1/8 wavefront are detectable, with great care and time twice that sensitivity can be achieved.
		
    <h4>Here are some examples to give you an idea how critically the Ronchi bands need to be judged.</h4>
	
    <p>
        Here's a 13.2 inch [34cm] F3.0 mirror (2008). I took great care to match the bands exactly including no turned edge, not knowing exactly how critical F3.0 required. However, there does appear to be a hint of a kink in the bands at the 70% zone. It does not show in the star test however. The results at the eyepiece are very pleasing at high powers.<br>

    <p>
        Here's my 24 inch [61cm] F6 from the early 1980's. The Ronchigram shows issues including a zonal kink at 50%, flat edge zones and an edge problem from the sling (slings are a gift from the Devil). Nonetheless, the mirror performed wonderfully at full aperture on planets at the highest powers and was tested professsionally at 1/4 wavefront.<br>

    <p>
        Here's a 18 inch f4 essentially perfect commercial quartz mirror. Note the ultra smooth curves. The point here is that the Matching Ronchigram test can still discern errors of miniscule nature.<br>

    <p>
        Here is a 14 inch [36cm] F5 mirror (1978). The curves look very close with no turned edge. This mirror proved an excellent performer both on deep sky and on planetary with a reduced size diagonal.<br>

    <p>
        Here's a 10 inch [25cm] F5 mirror (1976). Note that the mirror's bands are slightly too curved near the edge, indicating a low 90% zone with no turned edge and that the center is somewhat undercorrected. Nonetheless, this mirror proved excellent on planetary images.<br>

        Here's a 12.5 inch [32cm] F3.9 mirror made by Jerry Oltion. It gives a perfect star test with the slightest hint of a narrow turned edge. Jerry is using the old DOS version of my Ronchigram softaware.<br>
