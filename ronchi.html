<br>Moving inside the radius of curvature is a negative offset; outside
the radius of curvature is a positive offset. Inside of the radius of
curvature, the bands bow outward as you center your attention to the
middle of the mirror. Outside of the radius of curvature, the bands bow
outward as you move your eye towards the edge of the mirror. I have
included the option of overlaying quarter wavefront under and
overcorrection, and I have added an optional fourth Ronchigram where
you can common defects like under and over correction and a low or high
70% zone, all set to quarter wavefront deviation (maximum 1/4 wave peak
to valley on the wavefront). This comparison Ronchigram uses the third
and last grating offset.<br>
<br>
The Ronchi test, discovered by Vasco Ronchi in 1923, is one of the most
versatile and easy to use tests. It is an interferometer that can be
used geometrically. There is a large body of literature about the
Ronchi test. For a review, see Malacara&#8217;s, &#8220;Optical Shop Testing&#8221;,
second edition, chapter 9, &#8216;Ronchi Test&#8217;. I use the test geometrically
which measures the transverse aberration (the Foucault test measures
longitudinal aberration). The Ronchi test excels at measuring a wide
range of surfaces from spherical to aspherical (non-spherical) surfaces
such as the paraboloid.<br>
<br>
There are a number of variants of the Ronchi test including the Mosby,
the Null Ronchi, the Ronchi Star Test, the Concentric Grid Ronchi, the
Phase Shifting Ronchi Test, the Sideband Ronchi Test, the Lower Test,
and the Ronchi Hartmann and Null Hartmann Tests. I&#8217;m convinced that
there are variations on the Ronchi Test waiting to be discovered and
characterized. Inventive amateurs have suggested variants that I hope
to try in the future.<br>
<br>
I've successfully figured dozens of superb mirrors over many years
using the Ronchi Test with notable examples being 30 inch F4, 20 inch
F5 and my 13 inch F3 ZipDob and led mirror making classes using the
Ronchi as the principal test. I had a 6 inch F4 checked with the
Hartman test. The results were that the surface was 1/20 wave peak to
valley and the RMS was 1/60 wave (the defect that the Hartmann test
revealed, a broad high centered on the 50% zone, was also seen in the
Ronchi test, but I judged it not worth continuing to figure).<br>
<br>
One of the most successful practitioners was Dr. Sherman Schultz of
Macalester College in St Paul Minnesota. He used the Ronchi test in his
mirror making classes with countless students successfully completing
their telescopes. <a href="http://digitalcommons.macalester.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=physics_oralhist"> For a interview with Dr Schultz, select here.</a> See Telescope Making #9 for an article by Dr Schultz on the Ronchi test.<br>
<br>
He lists the following advantages of the Ronchi test.<br>
<ol>
  <li>Ease of interpretation. Leads to confidence which leads to a better mirror surface. Getting mired down in numbers, spreadsheets and equipment adjustments just isn't confidence inspiring.</li>
  <li>His students made 275 mirrors. Not a single student gave up or
quit. Testing can be the point of failure for telescope makers. But not
with the Ronchi test.</li>
  <li>The Ronchi test is sensitive enough to distinguish between excellent, good, fair and poor. Every little irregularity is seen.
It doesn't matter if the error is 1/6 or 1/8 wave - you don't need to
know the magnitude of the error. A drowning person doesn't need to know
how deep the water is once he is in over his head. He just needs to
know how to swim.<br>
  </li>
  <li>You work until the curves match. The curves are not a mysterious table of numbers or a grid
of coefficients. You can see the perfect simulated curve; remember it
in your mind's eye. Each mirror diameter and focal length combination
has its own curves (and for that matter, its own set of Foucault zonal
measurements).<br>
  </li>
  <li>You can easily detect, better than any other test, the most
common issue, that of turned edge. And the next most common issue,
zonal roughness.</li>
  <li>The student immediately recognizes the overall curve as compared
to the sphere. The correct corrective action is quickly devised. There
is no plotting of the mirror profile as reconstituted from zonal
measurements, which by the way, misses issues between the arbitrarily
designated zones.</li>
  <li>The test image is bright. The Ronchi test can be used in an
ordinarily lit room in daytime. It's easy to setup, easy to see, easy
to understand.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
The Ronchi test is the most effective test when the most important
question to answer quickly after each figuring spell is, "Is it better
or worse? Do I continue or change?" See my <a href="http://www.bbastrodesigns.com/mirlog.html">20 inch mirror log</a>
for an example of how to use the Ronchi test. The test is particularly
useful in mirror making classes where the mirrors come off of short
figuring spells and must be tested quickly lest a bottleneck builds.
It's common to have several mirrors waiting to be tested at any one
time.<br>
<br>
The Ronchi test reveals extremely small changes in the mirror's figure
such as zones and differences in correction from one part of the mirror
to the other. With care, I have observed defects down to 1/30 wave as
judged from other tests like the Caustic and interferometer. Turned
edges and overall smoothness are straightforward to detect.<br>
<br>
For best use of the test, compare three Ronchigrams at a series of
offsets from the radius of curvature. Use a sliding platform with a
threaded rod so that you can move the Ronchi tester precise distances
or use an engineering ruler taped to an adjustable platform, sliding
the Ronchi tester along the edge of the ruler precise distances. I use
a music stand for quick zeroing in of the Ronchi tester.<br>
<br>
Another approach measures the separation between Ronchigrams where the
inner Ronchigram shows the central bands separated by a precise amount,
say 1 inch or 2.5cm, and the outer Ronchigram shows the edge bands
separated by the exact same amount. The separation between Ronchigrams
should equal r^2/2R (mirror radius squared divided by twice the radius
of curvature).This can be used to gain a sense of overall correction.
This can be extended to intermediate zones.<br>
<br>
The Ronchi test is sometimes inappropriately applied by eyeing the
curvature of the bands. But this is difficult because the curvature can
look very similar for a whole series of situations. For instance, a 10
inch [25cm] F5, fully parabolized at 0.3 inch outside radius of
curvature (left image) will look very similar to the bands when a
quarter wavefront undercorrected at 0.285 inch outside radius of
curvature (right image). You can also see that for a 10 inch [25cm] F5
mirror, in order to achieve quarter wavefront accuracy, the tester must
be positioned to within 0.015 inch [4mm].<br>
<img style="width: 200px; height: 194px;" alt="" src="JoyOfMirrorMaking/10%20inch%20f5%20perfect%20correction%200.3%20offset.png"> <img style="width: 200px; height: 200px;" alt="" src="JoyOfMirrorMaking/10%20inch%20f5%20quarterwave%20undercorrected%200.285%20offset.png"><br>
<br>
How tightly must we judge the curved Ronchi bands? Perhaps
surprisingly, paraboloidal accuracy is solely dependent on focal ratio
(mirror size does not matter at all). This is also an indication of the
difficult of faster focal ratios where an F4 is twice as demanding as
an F8. The graph is for worse case 1/4 wavefront; for the more
demanding 1/8 wavefront, halve these values. While slower focal ratios
have a larger allowable parabolic deviation percentage, because the
paraboloidal correction is smaller, the deviation in absolute terms is
also smaller. I've added the capability to see the maximum allowed
under and over correction impact on the bands. Select 'zero correction
at edge' to best see center band changes and select 'zero correction at
center' to best see edge band changes. The conclusion is that
regardless of mirror diameter and focal ratio, the shape and curve of
each band must be judged critically from top to bottom.<br>
<img style="width: 440px; height: 288px;" alt="" src="acceptable%20parabolic%20devision.jpg">
<br>
I derived this relationship by using a standard algorithm that
calculates wave error given a set of zonal readings. I iteratively fed
it zonal readings smoothly varying by a correction factor, deriving the
maximum correction factor that fit the quarter wavefront error
envelope. For more, see the comments, code and unit tests in <a href="lib/Ronchi.js">lib/Ronchi.js</a> and <a href="lib/calcLib%20unitTests.htm">calcLib unitTests.htm</a>.<br>
<br>
You can see that zonal errors are easy to detect. Using a 16" [41cm] F5
mirror, compare a low 70% zone on the left (a common malady when
figuring large fast mirrors) to perfectly parabolized in the middle to
a high 70% zone (sometimes seen in commercial optics) on the right.
Note how the bands curve too sharply in the low 70% zone image,
particularly at the 70% zone, and in the high 70% zone image do not
exhibit enough curvature, looking too flat at the 70% zone.
Additionally, the center looks too flat in the low 70% zone and the
center looks too curved in the high 70% zone Ronchigrams.<br>

<br>
I like a grating of about 100 lines per inch [4 lines per millimeter].
It gives enough sensitivity without being overwhelmed with diffraction
effects on large fast mirrors. A spherical mirror returns light
emanating from the radius of curvature to its origin. The radius of
curvature is twice the focal length, the focal length is the mirror
diameter times the focal ratio. Light coming from astronomical objects
is essentially parallel. This light requires the mirror surface to be
shaped in the form of a paraboloid in order to bring the reflected
light to perfect focus. A paraboloid compared to a sphere has an ever
so slightly deeper center and edge. The result is that the light is
deformed as it returns from the mirror and passes through the grating
to the eye. This deformation is what we judge, comparing the mirror's
Ronchi bands to a computer generated series of Ronchigrams.<br>
<br>
Here are some examples to give you an idea how critically the Ronchi bands need to be judged.<br>
<br>
Here is a 14 inch [36cm] F5 mirror (1978). The curves look very close
with no turned edge. This mirror proved an excellent performer both on
deep sky and on planetary with a reduced size diagonal.<br><img style="width: 200px; height: 184px;" alt="" src="JoyOfMirrorMaking/14%20inch%20F5%20ronchi%20results.png"> <img style="width: 200px; height: 199px;" alt="" src="JoyOfMirrorMaking/14%20inch%20F5%20ronchi%20theoretical.png"><br>
<br>
Here's a 10 inch [25cm] F5 mirror (1976). Note that the mirror's bands
are slightly too curved near the edge, indicating a low 90% zone with
no turned edge and that the center is somewhat undercorrected.
Nonetheless, this mirror proved excellent on planetary images.<br>
<img style="width: 200px; height: 182px;" alt="" src="JoyOfMirrorMaking/10%20inch%20f5%20Ronchi%20results.png"> <img style="width: 200px; height: 207px;" alt="" src="JoyOfMirrorMaking/10%20inch%20F5%20ronchi%20theoretical.png"><br>
<br>
Here's a 20.5 inch [52cm] F5 mirror (1993). The curves match nicely
(somewhat hard to see because of bad seeing). This mirror has proved to
be one of my best mirrors, used regularly for critical high power
observing at 800x. One night of perfect seeing we were able to up the
magnification to 6000x with perfect star images.<br>
<img style="width: 200px; height: 189px;" alt="" src="JoyOfMirrorMaking/20%20inch%20f5%20Ronchi%20results.png"> <img style="width: 200px; height: 209px;" alt="" src="JoyOfMirrorMaking/20%20inch%20F5%20ronchi%20theoretical.png"><br>
<br>
Here's a 4 inch [10cm] F4 mirror (1972).The bands on the mirror's
surface are slightly under-curved. Nonetheless, this proved to be an
excellently performing mirror.<br>
<img style="width: 200px; height: 218px;" alt="" src="JoyOfMirrorMaking/4%20inch%20F4%20ronchi%20results.png"> <img style="width: 200px; height: 203px;" alt="" src="JoyOfMirrorMaking/4%20inch%20F4%20ronchi%20theoretical.png"><br>
<br>
Here's a 15.5 inch [39cm] F5.5 mirror (1980). Unfortunately I did not
record an outside of radius of curvature image, nonetheless, the bands
look smoothly curving and of proper amplitude with a hint of overall
undercorrection.<br>
<img style="width: 200px; height: 197px;" alt="" src="JoyOfMirrorMaking/15.5%20inch%20F5.5%20ronchi%20results.png"> <img style="width: 200px; height: 200px;" alt="" src="JoyOfMirrorMaking/15.5%20inch%20F5.5%20ronchi%20theoretical.png"><br>
<br>
Here's a 13.2 inch [34cm] F3.0 mirror (2008). I took great care to
match the bands exactly including no turned edge, not knowing exactly
how critical F3.0 required. However, there does appear to be a hint of
a kink in the bands at the 70% zone. It does not show in the star test
however. The results at the eyepiece are very pleasing at high powers.<br>
<img style="width: 200px; height: 186px;" alt="" src="JoyOfMirrorMaking/13%20inch%20F3%20ronchi%20results.png"> <img style="width: 200px; height: 205px;" alt="" src="JoyOfMirrorMaking/13%20inch%20F3%20ronchi%20theoretical.png"><br>
<br>
Here's a 6 inch [15cm] F2.8 mirror (2013). The star test looks very
good: excellent overall correction with a touch of overcorrection in
the 50-80% zones.<br>
<img style="width: 200px;" alt="" src="JoyOfMirrorMaking/6%20inch%20final%20Ronchigram%20outside%20RoC.jpg"> <img style="width: 200px;" alt="" src="JoyOfMirrorMaking/6%20inch%20target%20outside%20RoC%20Ronchigram.jpg"><br>
<br>
Here's a 10.5 inch [27cm] F2.7 mirror (2013). The star test shows
diagonal shadow breakout the same in both directions but with the above
focus position showing a brighter ring around the diagonal and the
below focus position showing a brighter ring on the outside meaning
that the outer 15% is very slightly overcorrected and the inner 85% is
very slightly undercorrected. Star test pattern improves as the mirror
cools to ambient air temperature. These issues are very slight.<br>
<img style="width: 200px;" alt="" src="JoyOfMirrorMaking/10.5%20inch%20final%20Ronchigram%20outside%20RoC.jpg"> <img style="width: 200px;" alt="" src="JoyOfMirrorMaking/10%20inch%20target%20outside%20RoC%20Ronchigram.jpg"><br>
<br>
Here's Jerry Oltion's 12.5 inch [32cm] f4.5 mirror that's been
parabolized to high quality: at 50x per inch of aperture [2x per
millimeter] the mirror focuses sharply and has an essentially perfect
star test with a slight brightening of the diagonal breakout ring
outside of focus, indicating a broad high zone between the center and
edge of the mirror. The third image is composed of the first two images
laid on top of each other showing that the mirror's 40-80% zone is ever
so slightly undercorrected. This gives you an idea of how carefully the
Ronchigram should be judged.<br>
<img src="JoyOfMirrorMaking/JO12inchRonchigramsActualTheoretical.jpg" alt="" style="width: 403px; height: 200px;"> <img style="width: 200px; height: 200px;" alt="" src="JoyOfMirrorMaking/JO12inchRonchigramComparison.jpg"><br>
<br>
Here's my old 24 inch [61cm] f6 from the early 1980's. The Ronchigram
shows issues including a zonal kink at 50%, flat edge zones and an edge
problem from the sling (slings are a gift from the Devil). Nonetheless,
the mirror performed wonderfully at full aperture on planets at the
highest powers and was tested professsionally at 1/4 wavefront.<br>
<img style="width: 242px; height: 208px;" alt="" src="JoyOfMirrorMaking/24%20inch%20Ronchigram.jpg"> <img style="width: 187px; height: 194px;" alt="" src="JoyOfMirrorMaking/24%20inch%20Ronchigram%20theoretical.jpg"><br>
<br>Here's a 36 inch f4 mirror professionally made to 1/4 wave. You can
see the kink and overcorrection in the outer zones. The star test was
iffy at highest powers. This demonstrates that the Ronchi test can be
used successfully on large fast mirrors.<br>
<img style="width: 200px; height: 198px;" alt="" src="JoyOfMirrorMaking/36%20inch%20f4%20Casino%20Ronchigram.jpg">
<img style="width: 200px; height: 196px;" alt="" src="JoyOfMirrorMaking/36%20inch%20f4%20Casino%20simulated%20Ronchigram.jpg"><br>
<br>
The Ronchi test is best thought of as a part of the figuring process.
Judging the 'after figure' against the 'before figure' in order to
decide what to do next is the most important question to ask and
answer. Perhaps you are concentrating on the 50% zone because it is a
tad too high (the Ronchi bands look too curvy at the 50% zone as you
slide your Ronchi tester back and forth, watching the bands expand,
change shape then contract). So you adopt a figuring stroke or modify
the pitch lap so as to concentrate on the 50% for a couple of minutes.
It is straightforward to see if the figuring stroke made the 50% zone
better (slightly smoother curve). The technique is precisely that:
slide the focuser back and forth, from inside radius of curvature to
outside. Judge what zone or zones the figure bends more than not. If
you are careful and take a modicum of time, then you will become quite
good at Ronchi testing while figuring your first or second mirror.<br>
<br>
Overall correction, that is, is the mirror 100% corrected or is it ever
so slightly under or overcorrected, is harder to see. That's where the
star test jumps into the fray. The star test, comparing the inside of
focus star pattern to the outside of focus star pattern, is exquisitely
sensitive to overall correction. There is every expectation that a
mirror can be figured to a standard of 'indistinguishable from perfect'
when using matching Ronchi test in combination with the star test.
Usually this only comes into play during the final stage of figuring. I
use the indoor star test when possible. Once I adjust the overall
correction then I return to the Ronchi test to get the correct curve in
each mirror zone.<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 500px; height: 375px;" alt="" src="JoyOfMirrorMaking/Ronchi%20frontside.jpg"> <img style="width: 500px; height: 375px;" alt="" src="JoyOfMirrorMaking/Ronchi%20backside.jpg">
<br>
As the figure takes shape and errors are no longer obvious, take the
time and care to judge the bands very critically. Be discriminating to
a deviation of one-tenth the thickness of a band. Position the tester
to a hundredth of an inch (1/4 millimeter) using an engineering ruler.
Testing in the final stages can take many minutes. Finally, regardless
of the test used, strongly consider verifying results against a second
test.<br>
