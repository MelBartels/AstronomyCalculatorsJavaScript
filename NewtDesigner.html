					<p>The history of the telescope is recorded in the march of better views through the eyepiece. I dream that the best views are yet to be seen. Revolutions in telescope design are driven by dreamers. Accurate digitized astronomical data, planetarium software, smartphones, coma correctors, well corrected wide angle eyepieces, meniscus mirrors, 3D printing, digital cameras and image processing software represent the vanguard of the latest in telescope design.

					<p>My revolution is driven by new conceptual thinking and a deeper appreciation of trade-offs in telescope design. For example, larger aperture reveals dimmer objects but narrows the field of view while increasing the scope's weight and eyepiece height. A larger diagonal promises more light to the edge of the field, but itself blocks more light at the center of the field.

					<p>I created 'NewtDesigner' to design my new telescopes, to best understand the optimizations and trade-offs. Perhaps you'll find 'NewtDesigner' useful too.

			<div class='panel'>
				<p>A telescope magnifies distant objects, making them appear larger. We call this magnification. An object made to appear five times larger is said to magnify ‘5x’.

				<p>At the same time, we expect the magnified image to reveal details otherwise invisible. An image magnified 5x should have five times more resolution otherwise we experience 'empty magnification', a blurring of the image. Aperture sets the limit on resolution: greater aperture means greater resolution. Matching our eye's resolution to the aperture resolution requires a magnification of roughly 25x per inch of aperture [10x per centimeter].

				<p>Magnifying a distant object also makes it dimmer as the light is spread out *. A distant object being magnified 5x will be 25 times fainter as the object’s apparent area has been increased by 25 times. Other than the bright planets, Moon and Sun, the vast majority of astronomical objects being unfathomably far away are jaw-dropping faint and tiny. Magnifying a distant astronomical object so that we can discern its shape or interesting detail also makes the astronomical object that much fainter. Increasing aperture is the key: an aperture five times the eye’s pupil at night will bring in 25 times more light, balancing the light loss due to magnification.<br>
				* Our telescopes cannot resolve a star into a disc so we never see the light spread out. Consequently stars do not dim with magnification.

				<p>Brightness is measured in magnitudes, a logarithmic scale. The absolute brightness of the Great Globular Cluster in Hercules, Messier 13 is -8.5 magnitude. Its distance from us is 22,200 light-years or 6800 parsecs, causing its absolute magnitude to dim from -8.5 to an apparent magnitude of 5.8. Its diameter of 170 light-years or 52 parsecs appears to us when we look up in the sky to be 20 arc-minutes diameter or one-third of a degree in diameter. The brightness per area, 5.8 magnitude spread over 20 arc-minutes diameter is 12.6 MPAM (magnitude per arc-minute squared) and given in arc-seconds squared is 21.3 MPAS (magnitude per arc-second squared).

				<p>Here is a table where you can compare <b>Messier 13</b> in three scenarios: absolute, in the sky and in a 10 inch [25cm] aperture telescope at a magnification of 100x.

				<p>Note that the 10 inch [25cm] aperture gathers 1000 times more light than the unaided-eye and spreads the light out by 10,000 times (100x squared). The total magnitude brightens by 5.0 but the surface brightness dims by 2.5 magnitude per arc-min squared. The contrast stays the same regardless of magnification, since magnification decreases the surface brightness of object and sky equally.

				<p>Key to visual detection is contrast: the difference in brightness between the astronomical object and the sky background. That’s what the eye and brain processes and makes conscious. Since the object is far away, behind our atmosphere, the sky background needs to be added to the astronomical object. Therefore, the contrast is the comparison between the astronomical object plus the sky background to the sky background (object+sky) / sky. Visually, an experienced observer finds a contrast difference of 6% obvious; a contrast of 3% takes time inspecting the field to discern. The object's apparent size is also important: an object that is 33 degrees in apparent size in the eyepiece is far easier to see than an object with apparent size of 20 arc-minutes. In a medium to large telescope, Messier 13 is stunning: bright, huge, with countless individual stars that can be seen and resolved. Here is what Messier 13 looks like through my 25 inch [64cm] F2.6 telescope at low power.<br>

			<div class='panel'>
				<p>The inventor of the reflecting telescope is even more difficult to pin down than the inventor of the refracting telescope which is still being debated today. There is a case to be made that the inventor of the reflecting telescope was actually <b>Thomas Digges (1546-1595)</b>, not Sir Isaac Newton.
				
				<p>I imagine that humans have held up pieces of glass to the sky for millennium; after all Egyptians were making glass lenses 5000 years ago and there's evidence that they knew that curved pieces concentrated the Sun's rays to start fires. Perhaps the quality of the glass was so poor that not much could be seen. Only after glass dramatically improved in clarity the 1500's was the telescope 'invented' in 1608, spreading like wildfire through Europe. Tantalizing historical fragments that could imply a telescope are well known: Aristophanes' play The Clouds, written in the 4th century BC, describes a 'transparent stone by which they kindle fire', a century later Euclid described refraction and reflection and Seneca the Younger (~65AD) wrote about lenses that magnified objects. The Camara Obscura was an important advance, first noted by the Chinese philosopher Mo-Ti in the fourth century BC and Aristotle in the third century BC then commented on by Anthemius of Tralles in the 6th century AD; later the astronomer Alhazen (1028 AD) correctly described the concept.
				
				<p>Writings from antiquity that might talk about telescopes include the Chinese emperor Tchuen hio, 2444 BC, who invented an instrument that gave a more distinct view of the heavenly bodies. The Babylonian Talmud, ~100 AD, describes a tube with which one could see a distance of 2000 cubits. Roger Bacon in 1268 AD wrote that refracting lenses can make distant objects appear closer and that print appears bigger when the lens is placed on the page. Not too many years later Italians began using bi-concave lenses to correct for loss of near-focus vision. Leonardo da Vinci essentially described a telescope using the mathematical rage of the day, catacaustic curves. Not knowing about the wave nature of light, he vastly underestimated the exactness needed for a good image. In the 1500's, with increasing frequency, more authors write about experiments with lenses.
				
				<p>By 1585, William Bourne writes, "... that the Glasse that ys grounde, beeynge of very cleare stuffe, and of a good largenes, and placed so, that the beame dothe come thorowe, and so reseaved into a very large concave lookinge Glasse, that yt it will shewe the thinge of marvelous largenes, in manner uncredable to bee beleeved of the common people." Here, largeness means focal length, not aperture. Bourne goes on, "Wherefore yt ys to bee supposed, and allso, I am of that opinyon, that having dyvers, and sondry sortes of these concave Looking Glasses, made of greate largeness,... yt ys lykely yt ys true to see a smalle thinge, of very greate distance, ffor that the one Glasse dothe rayse and inlarge, the beame of the other so wonderfully. So that those things that Mr Thomas Digges hathe written that his father hathe done, may bee accomplished very well, withowte any dowbte of the matter: But that the greatest impediment ys, that yow cannot beholde, adn see, butt the smaller quantity at a tyme." Here Bourne refers to the use of long focal mirrors for greater magnification, and he finishes by describing the narrow field of view of a telescope. Something that we understand today, but would have been unknown in the era.

				<p>Bourne describes concave reflectors being coated on the rear surface of tin or antimony plating. Of course this gives ghost images, due to reflections from the front surface of the glass mirror.

				<p><b>Did Digges turn his telescope to the heavens thirty years before Galileo?</b> In <b>1576</b> Digges writes in A Prognostication everlastinge, that the infinite universe is populated by stars "farr excellinge our sonne both in quantitye and qualitye...". And "Especially of that fixed Orbe garnished with lightes innumerable and reachinge up in Sphericall altitude without ende." The idea of an infinite universe appears to be new and the idea that there are stars far beyond what we can see with the unaided-eye suggests that he turned his telescope to the heavens.

				<p>Thomas Digges potentially connected with the Dutch spectacle makers like Lippershey as he was Muster-Master General for the English force helping Prince William fight the Spanish. As such he almost certainly met Jacob Metius's father. Jacob laid a competing claim to inventing the refractoring telescope to Lippershey in 1608.

				<p>In any event, once the word was out, the refracting telescope spread like wildfire throughout Europe. By 1609, <b>Thomas Harriot</b> in England was drawing the Moon using a recently acquired Dutch refracting telescope. Galileo also began observing in 1609, rapidly publishing and promoting his revolutionary observations. The idea of a mirrored telescope fell by the wayside to the new wondrous refracting design that Galileo was rapidly improving upon.

				<p>Like Galileo, <b>Sir Isaac Newton</b> did not mind getting his hands wet with grit. He was likely first to polish with a pitch lap. And he wanted to prove his theory that <b>white light was actually composed of a series of colors</b>. Newton quickly ran into a series of difficulties: the metal mirror had to be extraordinarily accurate and the metal tarnished. The problem <b>with Isaac Newton's 1672 telescope</b> is that he got the design wrong, didn't build a good model and didn't disclose his technique for decades. He wrote that his design of a telescope with a spherical primary and elliptical plane mirror was fully adequate. But it was not, as we now know.

				<p>A telescope of his design of four foot focus was brought to the Royal Society's attention shortly after and was found wanting. The truth is that the spherical aberration present in his design rendered it unusable. He did not know how to make parabolic mirrors. Isaac Newton's model received much attention but ended up sitting on the shelf making not the slightest impact for half a century.

				<p>Prior to Newton's design, <b>John Gregory devised an all mirror design in 1663</b> with a perforated parabolic mirror and a smaller curved mirror at the front of the tube sending light back down the tube. But the parabolic curves were far too difficult for opticians of his era and attempts to build the telescope failed.

				<p>In the same year as Newton's telescope, <b>1672, Sier Guillaume Cassegrain</b>, a sculptor (note the connection between his skill in casting metal sculptures and casting speculum mirrors), wrote of his design
				for a reflecting telescope, where Gregory's concave secondary mirror is replaced with a convex mirror. Today we judge Newton's invention as likely earlier that Cassegrain's, though it was hypocritical of
				Newton to criticize Cassegrain for using spherical mirrors. Regardless, the inventions of Newton and Cassegrain went nowhere.

				<p>These designs languished partly because neither Newton nor Cassegrain gave information on how to cast the mirror or how to grind and polish the mirror, though Newton did describe his polishing technique thirty years later.

				<p><b>Fifty years later, in 1722, John Hadley unveiled the first reflecting telescope worthy of the name.</b> Hadley had figured out how to parabolize his speculum mirrors. His telescope was a six inch f/10 on a solid altazimuth mount with slow motion controls. He had eyepieces that gave powers up to 230x.

				<p>His telescope was tested against a refractor of 123 feet focal length and found to be its equal in resolution though somewhat dimmer. With John Hadley's telescope, observers could see the five moons of Saturn,
				Cassini's Division and even Saturn's ring shadow on the planet itself. Unlike his predecessors, Hadley shared his polishing and parabolizing technique. His method of testing has been used ever since, particularly in modern times <b>by John Dobson</b>.

				<p><b>Thomas Edison is considered the inventor of the light bulb</b> not because he was first to demonstrate an incandescent light but because he developed the first practical and commercially viable electric light bulb. <b>Karl Benz invented the automobile</b> because he created the first true car though Leonardo da Vinci created the first designs. <b>Galileo invented the telescope</b> because he was first to grasp its astronomical potential and develop telescopes of increasing power even though <b>Lippershey was	first to publish</b> and is accorded prime inventor status.

				<p>Similarly, John Hadley could be considered the inventor of the reflecting telescope. It may be more proper to speak of looking through a <b>Hadleyian telescope</b> than a Newtonian.

				<p>The result of Hadley's invention cannot be understated. Once John Hadley showed his telescope and shared how to build it with others, opticians began making parabolic primary mirrors and the era of the reflector truly
				began.

			<div class='panel'>
				<p>A beautiful telescope opens the Cosmos, opens our soul, makes us feel alive. Our search for this beauty, for this quality, is the essence of designing, building and using a beautiful telescope. Patterns of beauty are all around us: in the Cosmos, in us. The stark vastness of the sky surrounds us; objects both bright and dim are simply wonderful. The telescope in our hands feels alive; we have a sense of the telescope: it feels good.

				<p>A telescope, from an engineering perspective, looks quite simple: an optical assembly that points up and down and rotates side to side. Yet a telescope mirror is arguably the most precise surface made by human or machine. It is accurate to two millionths of an inch [0.05 microns]. Guiding on an object calls for accuracy to one part in a million over a long period of time. We need to find objects in the sky to one part in 20 000. Most amateur telescopes built today are not precision machined. Instead they are built with simple materials and tools. How can this be? And what new telescope designs wait to be uncovered?

				<h4>Patterns, Symmetry and Process</h4>

				<p>A “living” approach results in a better designed, more usable and compelling telescope. Nature uses patterns, symmetry and process. A “living” approach results in measurable, objective beauty and quality. It is the emotional and compelling experience of using the scope. A “living” design repeatedly unfolds.

				<p>Design today, both hardware and software, unfortunately is sometimes thought of as an application of engineering principles and adjustments based on algorithms. It is not an organic process, the very process of Nature. This is a sign that something is wrong. Mimicking nature, design should be alive by growing organically through incremental development, filling in details later as needed. This tends to yield working systems. Especially with robotics and comprehensive sensors, telescopes are becoming more aware of their surroundings. Therefore the design must be simple and the implementation simple. The design should be correct; however it’s better to be simple. Consistency and completeness are important but must be sacrificed when necessary for simplicity. Designs fail one element at a time.

				<p>As an example, consider my 20 inch as it evolved through four iterations from 1994 to 2003. The initial design experimented with a single upper ring and computer control. Subsequent designs lightened the design. Ultimately I invented the TriDob for maximum portability through narrow RV doors, eschewing the computerized drive system.<br>

				<img alt='' loading='lazy' class='mediumSizeImage' src='20TriDob.jpg'>

				<p>Two of my A-frame designs showing the evolution of my thinking: a 12 inch and a 24 inch that was trailered (1980).<br>

				<img alt='' loading='lazy' class='mediumSizeImage' src='12 inch A frame Dob.JPG'>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' class='mediumSizeImage' src='24 inch Draco II at star party.JPG'>

				<p>A definition of elegant design is the optimal telescope that is achieved with the simplest, minimalist, least expensive effort. Elegance is the simplicity found on the far side of the complexity rainbow. The designer must avoid temptations like swinging for the fence to hit a home run, being too clever and solving frivolous problems. The result will be innovation. Don’t sit in a bathtub waiting to yell Eureka.

				<h4>Patterns</h4>

				<p>A pattern is a quality reusable solution to a common problem. Examples include stairs, gardens, model-view-controller and trusses. Advantages of patterns: begin work at conceptual level, worry about details at the last responsible moment, incorporate knowledge gained during earlier iterations and anticipate changes. Use language that users understand and judge what is of higher quality and more beautiful.

				<p>Common telescope patterns: trusses, rockers, image plane adapters, filters, observatories, thin mirror making, the Dob (breakthroughs occur when process used to vary symmetry breaking across many patterns, eg, John Dobson).

				<h4>Symmetry</h4>

				<p>Nature unfolds by breaking symmetry yet preserving structure. Breaking symmetry is a structure preserving change that strengthens centers and sharpens boundaries. Beautiful scopes have common characteristics: strong centers, clear boundaries, local symmetries and voids. Creativity is redefining us and our reality; it takes courage and endurance. Ideas can change; more than this they must change. We must master order so as to be open to chaos. To gain insight, we must love truth more than we hate error. Set high goals, identify critical functions, eliminate or improve functions then refactor and repeat. Example is the telescope tube: optics on both ends held with cylinder; cut away portions of the cylinder keeping only those portions that transmit load, leaving a truss or bay pattern. A large single cylinder can be replaced with numbers of smaller cylinders.

				<p>Example: Morse mounting from the 1940’s that used a mechanical drive system for an altazimuth mounting. This is the mechanical analogy to today’s software that translates between equatorial and altazimuth coordinates. The Morse mount is an equatorial to altazimuth mechanical computer. Look at the car in the background to set the age of this mechanical computer. Next is my evolution of the design, moving the analog mechanical computer to the side and incorporating an amillary design. <a href='newtDesigner.html#Morse' target='_blank'>See my webpage for more on the Morse Transformer mount and proposed modern derivatives</a><br>

				<p>Patterns of equatorial mounts: a horseshoe 8 inch and a fork 10 inch with cold camera (1975).<br>

				<img alt='' loading='lazy' class='mediumSizeImage' src='8 inch on deck.JPG'>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' class='mediumSizeImage' src='10 inch.JPG'>

				<p>Example: the focal plane pattern. By providing a flexible interface, I could swap between visual and cold camera imaging. The imaging platform featured a centered guiding double diagonal arrangement where the second diagonal caught the light that squeezed past the initial diagonal. I did five minute nearly unguided images with a touchup of Declination adjustment due to slight polar misalignment with my 14 inch telescope. Image taken with my cold camera, five minute exposure, Tri-X film, using the 14 inch with the unusual guiding arrangement.<br>

				<img alt='' loading='lazy' class='mediumSizeImage' src='14 inch guiding design.JPG'>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' class='mediumSizeImage' src='m42.jpg'>

				<p>Example: originally I was bothered by micro slippage in roller drives used on ultralight telescopes. I cast about looking for ways to turn the curved drive arcs into linear motions. Inspired by Holcombe, I studied scissors mount because of the large change in leg length. I discovered that lateral changes in the center of gravity are objectionable. Consequently, I created the glide mount that negated the lateral CG changes but allowed vertical changes, the vertical changes being symmetrically equivalent. This also dovetailed with my investigation of elliptical altitude bearings in that the center of gravity moves up and down but not laterally. Still, I was not able to overcome the cantilevered situation at either the horizontal or vertical position without complicating and compromising the design by adding a third support point, creating an inverse altitude rim. At this point, the symmetrically equivalent large Dob altitude rims seemed simpler. Center of gravity at mid-point along with a minimized eyepiece swing and strengthening the altitude rims to become the optical tube assembly become most important factors to elaborate from. I added folding or Origami concept for transport. The unifying concept was to squeeze air out of the telescope. Taking the iterative, one step at a time, I choose to use familiar materials with a restricted budget to stay within the three strikes (innovations) you’re out rule. This first decision is the first design and often involves the budget and materials. Any other sequence would have resulted in a different telescope.

				<h4>Using symmetry breaking as a way to explore options: considering optical alignment (collimation)</h4>

				<p>Collimating is the act of aligning all the axes of the optical elements. That means that the eyepiece axis as set by the focuser and the primary mirror axis are coincident or on top of each other. There are seven ways that break the symmetry of optical alignment that can be studied for little known telescope designs.<br>

				<img alt='' loading='lazy' src='dynamic collimation/perfect collimation.jpg'>

				<p><b>1. Primary mirror and diagonal.</b> The most common is a combination of primary mirror and diagonal. The diagonal's angle is adjusted to aim the eyepiece/focuser's axis at the primary mirror's center then the primary mirror's pointing angle is adjusted to bring its axis in line with the eyepiece/focuser.

				<p><b>2. Primary mirror, diagonal and focuser</b>. Sometimes the eyepiece/focuser's angle is adjusted with shims so that the focuser aims at the diagonal's center, thus all three elements are in play.

				<p><b>3. Primary mirror and focuser+diagonal as a unit.</b> One option with a binocular telescope is to treat the eyepiece/focuser and diagonal as a unit that is tipped such that the eyepiece/focuser axis is aimed at the primary.

				<p><b>4. Primary mirror+diagonal as a unit.</b> Another option with a binocular telescope is to adjust both the angle and position of the primary mirror and diagonal as an integral unit.

				<p><b>5. Primary mirror+diagonal as a unit and focuser.</b> Sometimes the eyepiece/focuser is adjusted in angle and position as well as the primary mirror and diagonal in a binocular telescope.

				<p><b>6. Primary mirror alone. </b>It is also possible to achieve collimation by adjusting the primary mirror in both angle and position. The primary mirror is first positioned such that its center is under the eyepiece/focuser axis, then the primary mirror is angled so that its axis is aligned with the eyepiece/focuser.

				<p><b>7. Eyepiece/focuser alone.</b> By the same reason it is possible to achieve collimation by moving the eyepiece/focuser to and fro to center it on the primary mirror's axis then tipping the eyepiece/focuser so that its axis is aimed at the primary mirror's center.

				<p>The last two combinations are of particular interest in that the number of elements to adjust is but one, either adjust solely the primary mirror or adjust solely the eyepiece/focuser. This could prove conceptually and mechanically easier to achieve.

				<p>Imagine a focuser mounted on a plate that can slide up and down plus left to right. Many focusers have tip or angle adjustment screws but if not the movement can be incorporated into this focuser mounting plate. How convenient would that be &#8211; all the collimation screws right there together at the focuser.&nbsp; The diagonal can be coarsely adjusted initially in order to center the illumination cone or be attached to the focuser mounting plate so that it moves in concert with the focuser always keeping the illumination cone centered.

				<p>Or imagine the primary mirror in the standard cell that provides for tip or angle adjustments where the cell can be moved side to side and up and down. For example, the two point mirror edge support can be built on a plate with slow motion controls such that the mirror slides to and fro. Then all the adjustments are made right there at the primary mirror. The adjustments can be motorized too by adding small servo motors to the threaded rod adjustment screws.

				<h4>Process</h4>

				<p>Process is a deliberate approach to symmetry breaking or structure preserving changes using patterns to create beautiful, living telescopes. Simplifying, removing and combining are periodically necessary. This beauty or quality is objective in that we observe it in nature and agree when we see it.

				<p>The process is simple: do the one most important thing in the simplest possible manner while preserving symmetry and structure; then repeat. Knowing what is the one most important thing to do comes with a strong unifying vision or product design and many hours of practice. To create new, living designs, it is also vital to be both a designer and builder, to have experience building as many components of the telescope as possible, whether grinding the optics or coding the control software or designing and building the mounting.

				<p>John Dobson imagined that the compelling purpose of a telescope on a sidewalk was to show the sky to the public. That meant aperture for bright views through the eyepiece. He gave up tracking, precision construction and Pyrex full thickness mirror blanks in order to fulfill his vision. He substituted low cost hand carry-able plate glass blanks. He substituted hand pushed stiction bearings for clamp with fine motion assemblies. He re-purposed concrete Sonotubes in place of aluminum and fiberglass tubing. He substituted binocular eyepieces for expensive telescope eyepieces. The culmination of all these changes was a new telescope design, compelling in its purpose. It’s dominated telescope design for the past 40 years. Night vision and electronically assisting viewing is opening a new evolutionary branch for sidewalk astronomy.

				<h4>Conclusion</h4>

				<p>Telescopes ten years from now will look different than today. With patience and perseverance, you can create and build a new telescope design. Even a simple accessory like the Telrad can change amateur 	astronomy. As popular as the Telrad is, it is not an endpoint. Rob and Quinn Brown's Qinsight finder is the next evolutionary step. I invite you to join others and me on the journey of amateur telescope making.

				<h3>Innovating in an era of addictive reactionary thinking or how I avoided becoming a servant to evolving technology.</h3>

				<p><b>I create exciting telescopes</b> by following a process that I've devised.

				<p>The biographies of my favorite all-time innovators, DaVinci, Lovelace, Curie, Turing show great imagination and deep thought. <b>I doubt that I can out-think them</b> - that would be arrogant and not conducive to innovating. I'll have to think differently, imagine differently, to make progress. To think differently I'll have to know their thoughts, so I make it a point to study the writings of innovative telescope designers.

				<p><b>Next I look to re-cast the problem.</b> For instance, when designing a new equatorial table, how did Poncet, Gee and D'Autumme see it? The essence of their innovations was to reduce the equatorial tracking motion to a pivoting platform albeit with limited tracking time. This led into bearing designs that better handled the center of gravity of big heavy telescopes. But what about the tracking motions of other mounts, like an altazimuth or even a 3-axis mount? How about screw jacks, sliders and lifters? Or even robotic styled motions like the hexapod? It also helps to have a box of	varied solutions and varied problems. Sometimes the key isn't a new	solution but a new problem that an existing solution could solve! For example, software startups that pivot to a new set of customers.

				<p><b>But how to build a repertoire?</b> My style is extensive reading in a variety of fields to build an array of different thinking.

				<p><b>Also I look for cognitive exhaustion.</b> Innovators tend to work on the main innovation. But left discarded on the floor are many new possibilities that could be tackled by someone stepping into the field.

				<p><b>Constraints are key.</b> I know it sounds paradoxical, but the more constraints that are placed, the	easier it is to arrive at either an astonishing solution or to find a clear contradiction or side-effect that terminates that problem-solution pairing. Usually dead ends are the result; time to recast for a different way to look at the problem. For example, in telescope collimation, could it be accomplished with un-orthodox movements of other elements? The answer is yes - <a href='NewtDesigner.html#collimation' target='_blank'>see dynamic collimation, the Andrew Angle, and the seven ways</a>: a thought exercise explicitly following my innovation process.

				<p><b>Innovation itself can be improved by following the innovation process</b>, a kind of recursion that makes it feel alive. As time goes on a grandeur scheme appears. I suppose its turtles all the way down. Or is it? Maybe the bottom turtle is saying, 'Umph', maybe upon a little re-orientation of perspective, its saying, 'I'm on top, I'm flying, I can see the stars!'

				<p><b>Turtles aside, it's important to have fun</b>: compelling and thrilling fun. That means spending time at the telescope's eyepiece, thinking how to make the view better and seizing opportunities when a better view comes along.<br>

				<img alt='' loading='lazy' class='mediumSizeImage' src='truths/ToolmakerThinkerTelescope.jpg'>

				<p><b>I want more aperture, more field of view with good ergonomics, e.g., a compact and lightweight scope.</b>

				<p>I can achieve all this by making three improvements in telescope design:

				<ol>
					<li><b>Meniscus</b> shaped mirrors (strong, lightweight and inexpensive).
					<li><b>F3.0</b> and faster mirrors (grind my own).
					<li><b>Precision molds</b> to slump flat pieces of glass into the meniscus shape in a homemade kiln.
				</ol><br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' class='mediumSizeImage' src='slump/30 inch slumped and annealed to f2.8.JPG'>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' class='mediumSizeImage' src='slump/42 inch after slumping and annealing.jpg'>

				<p>Because the glass is thin and cannot stand much grinding, the <b>slumped mirror must be precisely shaped</b> in the kiln by a precision mold. I made a series of 10 inch diameter molds to test refractory materials and devised a method of creating precision molds for the 30 inch and 42 inch mirrors, resulting in successfully slumping and annealing these large thin pieces of glass.<br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' class='mediumSizeImage' src='slump/30 inch and 42 inch molds.JPG'>

				<p>I'm conducting a <b>long winded experiment to see how meniscus mirrors scale</b>. How large of a meniscus mirror can I make and use successfully with a standard passive mirror support flotation system? Can I make a 12 inch mirror, or a 24 inch? How about a 48 inch or 72 inch mirror?

				<p>	My process is straightforward:
				<ul>
					<li>Keep the overall <b>amount of change to a minimum</b>. Innovation ideally involves modifying an otherwise innocent part of a well-known design in a simple way to achieve a new startling result.
					<li>Extrapolate with <b>fractal steps</b>, learning and adjusting as I go. I started with a 13 inch f3.0 slumped mirror, a small change in mirror shape from a 12 inch thinner mirror, albeit with a big change in the focal ratio. I devised a technique for parabolizing an f3.0 mirror. I followed up by an even faster but similar sized 10.5 inch f2.7 mirror to gain more experience. Scaling up, I have finished a 25 inch f2.6 mirror. See <a href='JoyOfMirrorMaking/25 inch f2.6 mirror.html' target='_blank'>JoyOfMirrorMaking/25 inch f2.6 mirror.html</a>. Next up are 30 inch and 42 inch very thin curved meniscus mirrors. Then maybe someday a 60 inch or even a 72 inch mirror.
				</ul>

				<p>Along the way these innovations have led to a <b>new folding telescope design</b> sans truss tubes with the center of gravity more in the middle of the scope thanks to the lightweight mirror, heavy eyepiece and coma	corrector.<br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' class='mediumSizeImage' src='ZipDob/ZipDobII/side.JPG'>

				<p>More crucially, I am treated to <b>sights I never dreamed</b>: very wide fields of view with significant aperture. For example the extremely faint dust bubble surrounding the Pleiades.<br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' class='mediumSizeImage' src='6inchF2.8/6 inch telescope iteration 2.JPG'>&nbsp;<img alt='' loading='lazy' class='mediumSizeImage' src='dneb/PleiadesBubble.jpg'>

				<p>One innovation of mine came from research. Upon reading the analysis of mirror edge supports in R.N.Wilson's two volume set, Reflecting Telescope Optics, I saw that the <b>two point support at 90 degree separation</b> is ideal for amateur large thin mirrors. I built such a mirror mount for my 20 inch and quickly other amateurs followed suit.

				<p> Another innovation of mine came from aesthetics, namely the desire of simplicity. Inspired by large observatory telescopes, I tried out a <b>single ring upper ring</b> on my 20 inch and found it elegant: the spider on one side and the focuser on the other. Once again fellow amateurs followed suit.

				<p>Yet another innovative mounting design is my Tri-Dob. This came about because the 20 inch telescope needed to fit through an RV door of maybe 18 inch width. I saw that I could split the altitude rim into forward and backward sections of differing diameters, folding up the forward altitude rim and then consolidate the back portion into a single fin. Later I saw that the 3.5m WIYN at Apache Point had a tail fin too.<br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' class='mediumSizeImage' src='TrilatBackSideView.jpg'>

				<p>Another innovation came from my strong desire to simplify. My innovation of PC based tracking and goto for altazimuth telescopes came from a desire to add back in the <b>tracking</b> that John Dobson eschewed in order to create the compelling Dobsonian. The simplicity was a very	simple hardware circuit board with the complexity being held in the	software. I aso opened sourced both the software and hardware. M13, taken with an early CCD using my computer guided 20 inch.<br>

			<div class='panel'>
				<p>One night while taking a long exposure astrophotograph, I accidentally walked into the scope’s counterweight. The one-ton telescope didn’t quiver in the slightest - perfect. On the other hand, the observatory Cassegrain was not the first that came to mind for a backpack telescope while on safari. No telescope can do it all. Further I have never encountered a perfect telescope; every telescope I’ve seen could be improved in some way, major or minor.

				<p>Quality is fitness to purpose. That one-ton equatorial Cassegrain was a good fit for long exposure astrophotographs. The 6 inch [15cm] Richest Field backpack telescope that I took on safari was the perfect choice to fly half-way around the world.What is it that you really want the telescope to do, above all else? Reveal faint fuzzies? Show tack sharp planetary views? Setup and tear down easily after a long drive to dark skies? Maybe a general purpose telescope that does a lot of things pretty well but admittedly is not optimized for any single purpose?

				<p>Even copying an existing telescope design can be challenging. Maybe you want to try different truss tube connectors, a different spider design. Maybe you want to try your hand at building the mirror cell. Each of these choices may or may not work out as well as you would like. It is darn near impossible to build a telescope well suited to your purpose on the first try.

				<p>Designing something new from scratch always needs prototyping and refinement. Sometimes I am not sure where the design is going until I build the first version. A number of times I have built paper models to better see their weak points. I have built several versions of a truss tube connector that I had in mind, inspecting each build, then revising and building again. Sometimes I have rebuilt the telescope from the ground up.

				<p>I use a combination of approaches including structural engineering, static and dynamic analysis, trial and error and studying other telescopes for strengths and weaknesses. Telescopes on one hand are simple affairs and on the other hand are complex moving structures with incredibly tight tolerances. Surprising issues include vibrational reflections, for example, rapping the upper end of many truss tube telescopes results in a quick dampening of vibration of the upper end that travels down through the truss tubes to the rocker but then reflects back up, causing the upper end to begin shaking again. The energy should be directed into the ground. Another example is astigmatism at high power caused by high frequency quivering of the diagonal. Yet another example is that many telescopes suffer from surprising deformation ruining optical alignment as the scope moves from horizontal to vertical.

				<p>I advocate iterative designing and building. Certainly don’t rush, don’t do a sloppy job, but do measure carefully, do use a CAD program if the design has complicated shapes that need to fit just so, but do not be afraid to build, inspect, think, and rebuild portions that are not fit to purpose. Do build something: I’ve seen more than one telescope in progress sitting on the shelf years later. Oftentimes, a problem with the design or build can be brushed away at first but eventually will bother you so much that you will rebuild the offending component.

				<p>There is wisdom to be gained by building that can be applied to future designs. There is no short cut though talking to other builders about what worked, what did not work and what they would do differently is valuable. I do not pay attention to unsolicited advice on the internet unless it is from a telescope builder with a thoughtful portfolio. One or two telescopes built does not make a master craftsman.

				<p>It helps to build with modularity and strong interfaces in mind. Don’t like the edge supports you built on the mirror cell? Design and build them in such a way that a better implementation can easily be swapped in. Don’t like the focuser board? Make it detachable so that you replace it with a board better fit for its purpose. Put the finder on an adapter board so that you can swap it out. Don’t like the pads that the telescope rides on? Make them replaceable assemblies – don’t directly nail them in. Make it part of your build process; expect to rebuild here and there.

				<p>Now you can build quickly, confidently, iteratively, replacing components as desired, eventually creating a telescope fit for the purpose you had in mind. Just don’t expect the telescope to be perfect, though you have my permission to dream that maybe the next telescope you build just might be the breakthrough perfect telescope of all time!

			<button class='accordion' id='btnFocalLengthApertureFocalRatio'>Relationship between focal length, aperture and focal ratio</button>
			<div class='panel'>
				<p><b>Focal length</b> is the distance that the primary mirror uses to bring the light to focus. Focal ratio times aperture also gives the focal length.<br>
				In many ways, the focal length sets the power of the telescope. Focal length sets the length of the telescope. Longer focal length telescopes are heavier thus more difficult to transport. Focal lengths greater than 60-70 inches [150-175cm] require a step stool or ladder to reach the eyepiece.<br>
				Since mirrors typically come in a limited range of focal ratios, the focal length sets the range of mirror sizes.<br>
				And the focal length along with the set of eyepieces determine the magnification range of the telescope along with the field of view.

				<p><b>Aperture</b> is the mirror diameter; the larger the aperture, the brighter the astronomical object.<br>
				Aperture also sets the maximum possible resolution.<br>
				And aperture factors in setting the image scale. For example, given the same focal ratio and eyepiece, a 20 inch aperture telescope shows an extended object, for example a galaxy, at twice the apparent size of a 10 inch aperture telescope. Our eyes can more readily detect larger apparent sized objects and detail is more visible.

				<p><b>Focal ratio</b> is the speed of the telescope and is found by diving the focal length by the mirror diameter.
				<p>Slower speeds of <b>F7-F8</b> favor resolution with higher magnifications in longer tube lengths. Slower speeds have little or no coma, do not require precise alignment and have a relaxed focusing tolerance.<br>
				<b>F5-F6</b> are general purpose focal ratios.<br>
				Faster speeds of <b>F3-F4</b> favor wider fields with lower magnifications in shorter tube lengths. Faster speeds also have more coma, require more precise optical alignment and have a tight focusing tolerance.
				<p><b>F3</b> allows the use of 100 degree apparent field of view eyepieces at lowest power for widest field and greatest light throughput or highest <b>etendue</b>. Etendue is the total amount of light flowing into your eye. Etendue is calculated as aperture squared times real field of view squared. A <b>coma corrector</b> is required for fast scopes at low power.

				<h4>Faster focal ratios</h4>

				<p>My 24 inch [61cm] F5.5 weighing 350 pounds that I finished in 1982 required a 10 foot aluminum ladder. The ladder is tiring to stand on and has to be moved constantly as the telescope tracks. And I could only take up to the focuser the eyepieces, filters and sketching equipment that I could carry in my pockets. I dreaded the accidental eyepiece impact test. In contrast using my 25 inch [64cm] F2.6 weighing 75 pounds that I finished in 2018 I observe sitting in my observing chair or standing on the ground with my eyepieces, filters and sketching equipment on a table next to me. The images are approximately at equal scale.

				<h4>Aperture implications</h4>

				<p>Let's consider relative brightness, focal ratio, resolution, seeing and ergonomic factors like telescope length and weight (2.5 power of the aperture). Here is the plot of all these factors together for apertures from 4 inches to 30 inches.<br>

				<img alt='' loading='lazy' src='ApertureImplications.jpg'>

				<p>Brightness increases proportionally with the mirror's area while resolution increases linearly with the mirror's diameter, subject to severe seeing effects in the larger apertures. All other factors trend negatively with increasing mirror size: ergonomically, telescope weight increases at the 2.5 power of the aperture and focal ratio decreases strongly as aperture grows for feet-on-the-ground observing (otherwise a ladder is needed).

				<ul>
					<li>The leftmost vertical line represents the historically popular 6 inch telescope. Note that it is the lightest weight, can be made in long focal ratios and tube lengths and is not generally limited by seeing. The 6 inch has three highly positive and two negative attributes distributed across a wide range.
					<li>The next vertical line represents a popular large scope size of 12 inches aperture. It's heavier, can be made up to F6 focal ratio though affected by seeing. The 12 inch has four attributes tightly grouped with a favorable ergonomic attribute.
					<li>The third vertical line from the left is the most popular very large scope size: 16 inches aperture. It's heavier yet, can be made to F4 focal ratio (thus not needing a ladder or coma corrector) and is limited by seeing. The 16 inch favors relative brightness with an increasing ergonomic cost; apertures up to 20 inches look similar but at increasing ergonomic cost.
					<li>The rightmost vertical line represents the largest scope size commonly seen in large star parties, 25 inches aperture. While the greatest brightness, all other factors are trending badly negative: very heavy, needs a fast focal ratio, requires a ladder and is strongly limited by seeing. The 25 inch favors relative brightness at the cost of four negative attributes.

				<p>Since the eye works semi-logarithmically, always keep in mind whether the aperture differences are meaningful.<br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' class='mediumSizeImage' src='truths/aperture differences.jpg'>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' class='imageTextWrap' src='Sombrero Galaxy through 6 and 13 inch telescopes.jpg'>

				<p>I compare two telescopes with a meaningful aperture difference, a 6 inch [15cm] and a 13 inch [34cm], and selected the galaxy, M104, the Sombrero Galaxy.

				<p>The Sombrero Galaxy is 8th magnitude and about 9 by 4 arc-minutes in size, well within the grasp of both telescopes. The galaxy is representative of many objects visible in amateur telescopes. The 13 inch gathers 1.7 more magnitude of light than the 6 inch.

				<p>If aperture is king then the view through the 13 inch should be vastly superior to the view through the 6 inch, given the same magnification, 55x, in both scopes. Surprisingly, that is not the case: the 6 inch is only somewhat inferior. This is also true at 150x, where the view through both scopes is noticeably better than at the lower magnification. Through the 6 inch the companion star was very faint and the nucleus non-existent. The star and nucleus was prominent in the 13 inch.

				<p>This observation shows that a smaller scope can do nicely, given sufficient magnification. But how much magnification is best? Should it be limited to 4-5mm exit pupil as commonly recommended?

				<p>Increasing magnification greatly enhances the view through both scopes. The Lowest power view for both scopes is 6mm exit pupil, medium power is 3mm exit pupil, and highest power is 1mm exit pupil. The best views occur at the highest magnifications. In fact, the view through the 13 inch at 320x is stunningly beautiful - now that's what visual observing is all about. This observation shows that <b>magnification for deep sky objects should not be restricted to 4-5mm exit pupil</b>, that in fact, high magnifications provide the best viewing.

				<p>The 6 inch can be considered an extreme case of illumination drop-off compared to the 13 inch, in this case a drop-off of 1.7 magnitudes! Since the 6 inch is only somewhat inferior, then perhaps the <b>common advice that off-axis illumination drop-off should not exceed 0.3-0.4 magnitudes is too tight. A drop-off approaching a whole magnitude, considering that it is the edge of the field of view, is a better recommendation</b>. Why is this so? I suspect it is because both the object* and the sky background lose brightness equally, preserving the contrast between the two as the illumination drops off.

				<p>*Technically, the sky background lies in front of the object, so contrast is actually sky background + object divided by sky background. The Sombrero Galaxy's brightness is ~20.5 mag/arc-second^2 while a country sky's brightness is ~21.5.

			<div id='apertureManagement'></div>
			<button class='accordion' id='btnApertureManagement'>Aperture management</button>
			<div class='panel'>
				<p>Aperture management is changing the aperture to extend telescope performance. There are three categories of aperture management.

				<ol>
					<li>By selecting an appropriate eyepiece, the telescope can achieve a lower magnification wider field with greater etendue.
					<li>Dealing with atmospheric turbulence
					<li>Envisioning a larger faster thinner primary mirror for a more versatile scope
				</ol>

				<p>Imagine a focal length, say 40 inches [102cm]. Focal length sets the telescope's length and greatly influences the telescope's weight. This length of telescope will fit across the back seats of most passenger cars and can be carried by most amateur astronomers. Let's consider a 10 inch [25cm] F4, a middle of the road aperture and focal ratio choice. The widest angle eyepiece that fits a 6mm exit pupil gives a 2.1 degree true field of view.

				<p><b>1)</b> We achieve a wider field with greater etendue by managing the aperture. Using a 42mm eyepiece with an apparent field of view of 72 degrees, we get a true field of view of 3.0 degrees. But what to do with the 10.5mm exit pupil? The answer is managing the aperture by stopping down to 6 inches [15cm] lowering the exit pupil to 6.3mm.The true field area doubles from 3.5 square degrees to 7 square degrees. Note that faster scopes are more extensible to lower magnification wider fields than slower scopes.
				<p>2.1 and 3 degree fields compared<br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' src='2.1 and 3 degree fields compared.jpg'>

				<p><b>2)</b> Turbulence in the upper atmosphere due to variations in the density (humid air weighs less) of air manifests itself as a quivering image in smaller apertures and a blobby boiling image with larger apertures. While typically more detail is visible with larger apertures, the image can be less aesthetically appealing. By managing aperture we stop down the mirror until the image aesthetic is acceptable commiserate with detectible detail. In fact, with very large apertures we can utilize an off-axis mask using light that goes between the spider vanes resulting in an unobstructed view. For example, a 25 inch [64cm] telescope with a 5 inch [13cm] secondary can have a 10 inch [25cm] unobstructed aperture. On any given night, each planet has its optimal magnification where apparent size is balanced with seeing. And each planet has its optimal aperture.
				<p>A professional study in the 1950's looked at two optimizations: what aperture is best for highest resolution viewing the majority of the time and what aperture will give the highest resolution view regardless of how long the observer has to wait for a moment of clarity. The answers are 11 inches [28cm] and 16 inches [41cm]. This matches well in the field of high resolution digital imaging where the best amateurs use apertures up to 16 inches, discarding the inferior images, and matches well with anecdotal amateur thinking that up to 12 inches is the optimal aperture for planetary viewing though larger apertures display better views at certain times.

				<p><b>3)</b> Finally we imagine squeezing our 10 inch [25cm] mirror into a thinner faster mirror of greater aperture, for example, a 15 inch [38cm] F2.7 of same focal length. Then we have a series of apertures from 5 inch [13cm] unobstructed off-axis to the full 15 inches [38cm] that we can use to manage for best view in the eyepiece.
				<p>Comparing 10 inch [25cm] standard thickness F4 to 15 inch [38cm] thin meniscus (mirror weighs but 20% more) F2.7 with identical 40 inch [102cm] focal lengths<br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' src='10 inch F4 and 15 inch F2.7 mirrors.jpg'>

				<p>Just as photographers change the effective aperture by selecting different f-stops, we should consider varying aperture to favor the views we want based on the seeing that night and transparency of our site. For a smaller aperture scope consider an off-axis mask along with full aperture. For a larger aperture scope, consider an off-axis mask with one or two intermediate sizes along with full aperture.

			<div id='resolution'></div>
			<button class='accordion' id='btnResolution'>Resolution</button>
			<div class='panel'>
			
				<p>Resolution is set by the diameter of the main optic, this due to the diffractive nature of light. Dawes determined empirically that resolution of two stars of the same brightness and not too bright is about 4.6 / aperture inches or 240 / aperture millimeters. For example, roughly speaking, a 5 inch [125mm] telescope can resolve a double star of one arc-second separation, a 10 inch [25mm] resolves 1/2 arc-second.
				<p>That doesn't mean that we cannot see thinner objects, for example, we can see very thin black wire against a blue sky, though we cannot resolve the line's thickness.
				<p>A central obstruction acts to shrink the Airy disc slightly and dump this light into the rings. This lessons the resolution of close-in detail and slightly increases resolution of coarser detail. An obstruction of 1/5 diameter ratio (e.g., a secondary of size '2' with a primary of size '10'or 20% has a negligible impact on resolution while an obstruction of 1/3 or 33% has an observable impact. Even so, the impact on the finest resolvable detail is minimal. However, obstructions greater than 40% should be avoided.
				<p>Adding aperture makes up the difference. For example, a telescope of size '10' with a secondary of size '2' is equivalent to an unobstructed telescope of size '8'. This is also true for optical quality, in that a larger optic of 1/4 wave front will resolve better than a smaller perfect optic.
				<p>Put another way, an obstruction of 1/3 or 33% has the impact of adding spherical aberration of 1/4 wave front; an obstruction of 1/5 or 20% is equivalent to a wave front rating of 1/8. Combining real life optical quality with central obstruction means that a telescope with a central obstruction of 1/4 or 25% and spherical aberration of 1/4 wave front degrades the image equal to that of an unobstructed telescope of 1/3 wave front, which no longer meets the criteria of resolution.
				<p>However we should be mindful of numbers and their subjective impact. The difference between 1/4 and 1/3 is but 1/12, small indeed. So it is a gradual decay of optical quality.
				<p>The Rayleigh criteria for resolution says that the optical error should be no more than 1/4 wave front, meaning that the performance of the optics is dominated by the diffractive nature of light, not the optical aberrations.
				<p>The Marechal criteria says that the optical quality should be 1/14 wave RMS (as distinguished from PV or Peak-Valley); a smooth spherical aberration of 1/4 wave front being equivalent to 1/14 RMS.
				<p>The Francon criteria says that an optical system that is 1/16 P-V at the wavefront can be deemed perfect or indistinguishable from an optical system with no aberrations or errors.
				<p>A telescope of lowered optical quality is more impacted by seeing, since the optics are closer to the edge of unsatisfactory.
				<p>A lack of perfect focus and a lack of adequate optical alignment also act to degrade optical performance.
				<p>An aberration on a lens produces 1/4 the error that of a mirror.
				<p>Smaller mirrors up to 12 inches [30cm] should be at least 1/8 P-V wave front and smooth (an RMS of about 1/30 wave front) and larger mirrors at least 1/5 P-V (1/18 RMS wave front). Larger mirrors can be plagued by zones therefore the RMS becomes an increasingly important measure. Lower quality than this readily shows at the eyepiece.

			<div id='turbulence'></div>
			<button class='accordion' id='btnTurbulence'>Notes on seeing and atmospheric turbulence</button>
			<div class='panel'>
				<p>The theory of atmospheric seeing was developed in the '60's-'80's and is now well proven. Measuring the temperature structure coefficient predicts image quality (essentially, a plot of index of refraction versus altitude).

				<h4>Seeing</h4>

				<p>Seeing is directly related to high-frequency temperature fluctuations associated with turbulence.<br>
				Atmosphere above a site is divided into four layers: surface, planetary	boundary, atmospheric boundary and the free atmosphere.<br>
				Turbulence is generated in the surface layer by wind shear due to frictional/topographic effects from the surface. Height of this layer set	by the roughness of the ground, eg, trees and boulders. Layer's extent is 10 to 100 feet high. Telescopes at Apache Point are situation up in the air so that the optics sit above this layer. Isolated peaks (not ridges) are	best because air&nbsp;flows around rather than over the surface.<br>
				The planetary layer holds the air that's heated by the Sun and moves up and	down vertically. The upper limit is the inversion layer, typically 3000	feet.<br>
				The atmospheric boundary layer sits on top of the planetary layer and is free of convention but is affected somewhat by the ground, e.g.,	mountains.<br>
				The free atmosphere is unaffected by the ground. Turbulence is caused by the jet stream, creating vertical temperature gradients above and below the jet stream, 7 miles up. Jet stream velocity is highest in the
				mid-latitudes, so best to observe on nights when the jet stream is	'elsewhere'.<br>
				Inland sites can be quite good as long as they face into undisturbed air. Large flat plains downwind from mountain ranges can be as good as coastal	or island sites.

				<h4>Turbulence</h4>

				<p>Direction of light affected by differences in index of refraction of air.<br>
				Index of refraction of air changes with air temperature (not humidity, and	not wind speed) in the free atmospheric layer or in the surface layer next to the scope.<br>
				Seeing depends on temperature differences and not on wind. The temperature difference between the adiabatic cooling rate and the actual air	temperature is dissipated by the creation of smaller and smaller eddies on	a fractal scale that eventually transform into heat. Turbulence occurs in very thin 10-20 feet deep layers.

				<p>What is the structure of thermal turbulence?<br>
				Turbulent energy in atmosphere produced by buoyancy and wind shear on scale	of tens of meters.

				<h4>Turbulence in the Inertial Subrange</h4>

				<p>Energy created by turbulent eddies, and passes through the Inertial	Subrange, where smaller and smaller eddies are created.<br>
				Eventually eddies on scale of millimeters created.&nbsp; Sheers in these small eddies are so large that air viscosity transforms their kinetic	energy into heat, stopping the eddy creation process.<br>
				It's in the thermal subrange where thermal fluctuations occur.

				<h4>Characteristics of Seeing</h4>

				<p>R0, called the "Fried Length" or "coherence length", permits simple characterization of seeing.<br>
				R0 is the diameter of light rays that stay parallel through the	atmosphere.<br>
				R0 at best sites range from 10-30cm [4-12 inches]. Seeing disk is 1/2 to 1/3 arc-second. The coherence time is 10-50 milliseconds and the isoplanatic angle is 2-10 arc-seconds.<br>
				Image degradation comes in two forms: image motion and image blur. Smaller	apertures suffer from image motion and large apertures suffer from image blur.<br>
				Can be observed by noting the largest aperture where stars appear to shimmer yet are sharply defined.&nbsp; Larger apertures show steady but bloated stars.

				<h4>What Aperture is Best?</h4>

				<p>R0, the Fried Length, suggests that best aperture is 10-30cm [4-12 inches]. However, seeing is highly variable. For us in Oregon, in northwestern USA, when the jetstream is overhead seeing is atrocious, confirming the notes	above. When the jet stream is elsewhere (British Columbia or California)	seeing can be quite good. Further, locally, at my house, when the nighttime	mountain breezes start, seeing disintegrates. Nonetheless, the breeze is not continuous and patience is rewarded with good views. There are nights of near perfect seeing, where magnifications from 750x upward can be used. Finally, there are the rare nights of perfect seeing. On one such night I	double barlowed with a very high power eyepiece and reached 6000x on my 20 inch [51cm] F5. The stars showed perfect Airy disks. What was interesting, 	besides the weird effect of such a small exit pupil, was that fainter stars	still looked relatively pinpoint-ish. The rings around the Airy disk were too faint to be seen and indeed, the Airy disk itself was not of equal brightness throughout and instead tapered towards the edge. Of course,	resolution was not changed.<br>
				This matches my experiences observing through 40 inch [1m] telescopes on nights of good seeing at 750-1200x. The stars were pinpoints, aesthetically very appealing. Also visual observers favorably comment on viewing through	80 and 90 inch [2m and 2.3m] Cassegrains.<br>
				Therefore there is a subjective factor of up to 8X in visual observing	depending on seeing conditions and observer patience.<br>
				The percentage of nights with excellent seeing versus average seeing is a probability function with a long tail. Nights of excellent seeing are one	in ten to one in fifty, or several times a year.

				<p>Scopes larger than the Fried Length are also preferred when digitally imaging the planets. Perhaps the median scope here is a 16 inch [40cm]. MacEvoy says that the best aperture is 3.5 * R0, or ~ 14 inches [35cm] for	R0 of 10cm. At this aperture it is virtually certain that lucky imaging	will greatly increase image quality. That is because the extra aperture	allows short exposures that freeze the seeing, the hundreds to thousands of	images taken are gone through after the fact where the worst ones discarded	and the best ones are stacked into a single image of exquisite detail.

			<div id='airy'></div>
			<button class='accordion' id='btnAiry'>What you need to know about the Airy Disk</button>
			<div class='panel'>
				<p><b>Why should I care?</b> The smallest spot of light that a perfect lens or mirror can focus is the Airy disk.

				<p><b>What is the Airy disk?</b> Light going through a circular opening	forms a spot of light surrounded by ever fainter rings. A telescope lens or	mirror bends or reflects light to a focus. The aperture of the lens or	mirror is the circular opening.

				<p><b>Why a discrete spot size and rings?</b> Light diffracts because it has wave properties. Think of the famous slit experiment where light or electrons, anything that has wave properties travel through a slit.
				Projected on the wall will be a fuzzy image of the slit (the equivalent of the Airy disk), surrounded with ever fainter straight bands. Make the slit a circular opening and now the fuzzy image of the slit becomes a fuzzy disk surrounded by ever fainter rings. Incidentally this demonstrates that pattern or shape of the diffraction is caused by the shape of the opening, not caused by the edge of the opening.

				<p><b>What is the size of the Airy disk?</b> There are two ways to measure the Airy disk. The first is the linear size as if we had an incredibly precise ruler. For green light, the diameter is 0.00124 mm times the focal ratio. For example, an F8 scope has an Airy disk diameter of 0.00124*8=0.01 mm. In inches it is 0.00005 times the focal ratio. For example, an F8 scope has an Airy disk diameter of 0.00005*8= 0.0004 inches.<br>
				The second is measuring the angular diameter of the Airy disk. For green light, the diameter of the Airy disk in arc seconds is 260 divided by the lens or mirror diameter in millimeters. For example, the Airy disk’s angular size for a 150mm diameter lens or mirror is 260/150= 1.8 arc-seconds. In inches it is 11 divided by the lens or mirror diameter in inches. For example, the Airy disk’s angular size for a 6 inch diameter lens or mirror is 11/6= 1.7 arc-seconds.

				<p><b>How can it be that the linear size of the Airy disk depends only on the focal ratio?</b> Because that's what remains when the math terms cancel. But why is that? Let's make up the following example.<br>
				Scope 'A' is a 6 inch [15cm] F8,<br>
				scope 'B' is a 12 inch [30cm] F4,<br>
				scope 'C' is a 6 inch [15cm] F4.<br>
				Scopes 'A' and 'B' have the same focal length,<br>
				scopes 'A' and 'C' have the same aperture,<br>
				scopes 'B' and 'C' have the same focal ratio.<br>
				Scope 'B', with twice the aperture resolves twice that of scope 'A' so  the Airy disk is half the size of scope 'A'.<br>
				Scope 'C' with the same aperture of scope 'A' resolves the same but with half the focal length, the Airy disk diameter is half the size. So I see that the Airy disk diameter depends solely on the focal ratio where faster focal ratios result in smaller Airy disk diameters.<br>
				Scope 'B' resolves twice that of scope 'C' but with twice the focal length the Airy disk ends up the same linear size.

				<p><b>How does resolution relate to the Airy disk?</b> Resolution is typically taken as half the Airy disk. For a 15cm, 6 inch lens or mirror, the resolution is 0.8 arc-seconds.

				<p><b>Why do I care about the size of the Airy disk?</b> If I am an imager, then I want to match my camera’s resolution to the telescope’s resolution. I’ll alter the camera or telescope to make the match. If I am a visual observer, then I want to know the resolution limit of my telescope. Visually I will select eyepieces that allow my eye to resolve the telescope’s theoretical resolution limit.

				<p><b>How does the Airy disk play into mirror making?</b> For a smooth mirror the optician wants all the geometric light rays to pass through the Airy disk. The optician needs to know the size of the Airy disk when testing with an artificial star or say the Foucault test.

				<p><b>Who was George Biddell Airy?</b> Sir Airy was an English astronomer and mathematician who became Astronomer Royal, reorganizing the national observatory. He’s famous for many accomplishments including establishing the prime meridian and measuring the density of the Earth. In 1831 he described diffraction of circular apertures and a complete theory of the rainbow. He also discovered the 243 year Venus cycle. Controversially he is blamed for losing the race to discover Neptune to the French.

			<div class='panel'>
				<p>The value of a telescope is the value of the observations or images made with it. The potential of making valuable observations or images is illustrated by the following formula:

				<p>TV = A * F * f<sub>e,f,a</sub> * f<sub>u</sub> * f<sub>s</sub> * f<sub>x</sub>, or<br>
				Telescope Value = Aperture * FieldOfView * function(eyepieces,filters,accessories) * function(usability) * function(skies) * function(experience)

				<p>Aperture is so important that we amateurs talk about aperture fever. I can see more with a bigger scope: objects are brighter and more detailed. Yet aperture isn't the only factor...

				<p>Larger apertures have smaller fields of view. Many Milky Way objects such as bright and dark nebulae profit from a field of view of several degrees, whereas that one meter 40 inch telescope that we all lust after has a low power field closer to half a degree. Field of view trades off with aperture.

				<p>Eyepieces, filters and accessories function to enhance viewing, and sometimes are indispensable, for instance, a nebula filter in light polluted skies.

				<p>Usability or ergonomics sadly is often ignored. We don't think of the sore neck or strained back that can result from an uncomfortable eyepiece angle or lifting a heavy telescope into the back of a car. Well thought through ergonomics can enhance viewing: sitting on an astronomer's chair while observing allows me to concentrate on difficult details.

				<p>Dark skies with good transparency and excellent seeing can make all the difference. They allow small scopes to achieve what large scopes can show in light polluted skies. Rare nights of perfect seeing when astonishing magnification can be used stay with me for years.

				<p>The experience of the observer is a major factor. An experienced observer will see more with a smaller scope than a newbie with a larger scope.

				<h4>Function (usability) is not only ergonomics but also TTO and TEO.</h4>

				<p>TTO is Total Time to Observe. TEO is Total Effort to Observe.

				<p>I'm not talking telescope setup time or time to locate an object.

				<p>TTO is the time from first thinking about observing to the initial looks through the eyepiece. The shorter this time, the more I observe. TEO is all the effort I have to put forth leading up to looking through the eyepiece.<br>

				<img alt='' loading='lazy' src='TTO.jpg'>

				<p>The sky clears as I eat dinner. It would sure be great to take advantage of the sky. The quicker and easier that I can setup in the driveway or backyard, or throw the scope in the back of the car and drive to a nearby observing point, the more likely I'll observe that night.

				<p>Sure, that big aperture scope is wonderful, but the truth is that I'm not as likely to go to the hassle of lugging it out and setting it up if it is heavy or has a lot of pieces, or needs tweaking every time. I did myself a huge favor and built a couple of smaller aperture scopes that setup instantly and that are a joy to point and look. A four, six or eight inch scope, quick to setup, is perfect. I reserve my big gun for those times when it is OK for my TTO to be long and for my TEO to be heavy, like a major star party or a long weekend trip to very dark skies.<p>

				<p>Do yourself a favor too by shortening your TTO. Oh, and lighten up that TEO while you are at it too!

			<div class='panel'>
				<p>Five factors dominate telescope performance:
				<ol>
					<li>Thermal effects in the primary mirror. If the mirror is not at air temperature, the glass can distort and the air just in front of the mirror will boil.
					<li>Optical alignment.
					<li>Seeing: the quality of the atmosphere immediately surrounding the telescope and the turbulence of the upper atmosphere.
					<li>Mirror cells: most hold the mirror without strain or distortion. I've witnessed more badly built mirror cells that deform the optics than poor mirrors.
					<li>Optical quality: optical quality in the modern era is good and is invariably a non-issue though often mistaken for other more dominate factors.
				</ol>

				<p>Inexperienced amateurs are quick to question the primary mirror's quality while experienced amateurs understand that other factors dominate in the field particularly with larger apertures.<br>

				<img alt='' loading='lazy' src='Large telescope performance.jpg'>

				<p>These factors can be judged at the eyepiece with the star test, a subjective and sensitive test, that works by dynamically examining the distribution of light. For more <a href='JoyOfMirrorMaking/StarTesting.html' target='_blank'>see my star test page</a>.

				<h3>What the telescope means to me</h3>

				<ul>
					<li>Personal gratification using a tool that one made themselves
					<li>Share experiences with others
					<li>Connection or sense of one's place in the universe
				</ul>

				<h3>Looking through the telescope and imaging with the telescope</h3>

				<ul>
					<li>Breathtaking views, visual experience, closeness to the objects in the universe; best if travel to dark skies
					<li>Detailed digital images; needs image processing
				</ul>

				<h3>The 'ilities</h3>

				<ul>
					<li>So few hours under the stars therefore ergonomics becomes the dominate factor in order to maximize time
					<li>Telescopes better if lighter, easy to assembly, reliable to assemble, able to see lots of objects easily
					<li>Telescope pointing is an issue since the telescope magnifies the objects, vastly narrowing the field of view. There are two	approaches:
					<ul>
						<li>Computer aided finding (creates a software model of the sky, aims the telescope, usually needs positional encoders and a library of objects)
						<li>Hand pushed telescope mounting: intuitive (no computer,	motors, encoders to go wrong)
					</ul>
					<li>Need a variety of magnifications, ie, eyepieces (or perhaps more than one telescope)
					<li>Need good focusing: easy and accurate
					<li>Good views means good optics adjusted to night temperature
					<li>Contrast comes from baffling
					<li>Filters enhance both nebulae and planets
				</ul>

				<h3>A user story</h3>

				<ol>
					<li>I'm eager to observe
					<li>skies forecast looks good
					<li>quickly load up scope in car
					<li>drive to site
					<li>setup scope (in darkness)
					<li>use scope until tired
					<li>preplanned observations for whimsical observing
					<li>quickly load up scope
					<li>drive home safely
					<li>good memories, good emotions and good satisfaction
					<li>maybe combine with other purposes like camping, vacation
				</ol>

				<h3>Aperture versus ergonomics</h3>

				<p>The telescope's aperture, or diameter of the optics, is the dominant factor (object detail and magnification, price, size, complexity). Since there are several factors, trade-offs necessarily occur based on the user's dominant needs.

				<p>The desire for aperture is called 'aperture fever'. The rationalizing goes like this: aperture is an important factor, astronomical objects are dim	afterall, therefore more of it is better, in fact you might miss out if you	don't get the biggest scope possible.

				<p>Nonetheless, ergonomics trump aperture since a large difficult scope not used is no scope at all. It's harder for us to rationalize ergonomic factors because the penalty occurs in the future and we see ourselves as flexible. "Yes my new ultra huge scope X is heavy and complicated, but I'll be motivated to carry it every night and spend half an hour setting it up, I promise". Worse, when that ultra huge scope X does show up on the doorstep, we are highly motivated to get out and observe with it. We ignore ergonomics for the time being. Gradually though ergonomic factors dominate with the result that scope X isn't actually used that much. A smaller grab-n-go scope is then purchased.

				<p><i>Time under the stars is precious, therefore ergonomic factors will eventually dominate.</i>

				<h3>Ergonomic requirements</h3>

				<h4>Setup/teardown</h4>

				<ul>
					<li>easy, quick, reliable assembly including accessories
					<li>easy to lift scope or parts
				</ul>

				<h4>At the scope</h4>

				<ul>
					<li>engagement with the telescope
					<li>variety of objects accessible
					<li>good eye height for eyepieces (no ladder)
					<li>accurate focusing
					<li>good baffling
					<li>pointing is 2nd nature and intuitive, does not get in the way of observing
					<li>easily aimed
					<li>good optics
				</ul>

				<h4>Price</h4>

				<ul>
					<li>telescope
					<li>eyepieces
					<li>filters
					<li>accessories
					<li>truck, trailer to haul really big scopes
				</ul>

				<p>Do we think of telescopes as the object then adapt them and ourselves to fit, or do we start with objects to observe, then consider our eyes, selecting eyepieces and finally the
				telescope? Perhaps we need to consider both ways. That means:
				<ul>
					<li>eyepiece turrets
					<li>filter wheels
					<li>multiple telescopes available<br>
				</ul>

				<h3>What is a folding telescope?</h3>

				<p>A folding telescope unfolds to observe and folds backup to transport. The telescope bends over at the pivot points so that one part fits on top of or within another part.

				<p>Here's my folding 13 inch telescope being unfolded during the 2011 Oregon Star Party Telescope Walkabout.<br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' src='FoldingScopes\MelBartelsUnfolding1.jpg'>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' src='FoldingScopes\MelBartelsUnfolding2.jpg'>

				<p>And here I am observing at night with the scope (image courtesy Craig Stott).<br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' src='ZipDob/observing at OSP 2011.gif'>

				<h3>What is a sliding telescope?</h3>

				<p>A sliding telescope slides in one direction to observe and slides back to transport. The telescope's parts slide over each other so that they fit within each other.

				<p>Here's Bert Bogchelman's scope that unfolds in seconds. Bert says, 'The telescope has a very quick setup, within a few seconds you can set up and collapse the tube. I have build a few truss Dobsons (I still have the word record smallest 8 inch) but I was sick and tired to set them up and even worse, to collapse them again after a long night of observations.But a full tube 12.5 inch Dobson has a huge tube and don't fit in a small car. So, I build this telescope and honest, I am very, very happy with it. I have had a star party a few weeks before, and I was the only one with a big telescope who was able to look between the rain showers. 

				<p>After the launch (3 seconds) you only have to turn the focuser and the finder from inside the tube to outside, and they snap into their places with magnets. The scope needs after setup only some minor collimation, like a truss design.

				<p>Some details:<br>
				Collapsed high: 61cm<br>
				Weight: 23 kg all-in (incl. the rockerbox), so you can carry the hole telescope in one.<br>
				12.5 inch F5 Strehl 0.94 mirror<br>
				Secondary mirror: 63 mm (20%)<br>
				2 inch Antarsi helical focuser<br>
				50 mm finder, right angle, correct view (Amici prism)

				<h3>What is not a folding/sliding telescope?</h3>

				<p>Any telescope that doesn't fold or come apart or requires assembling or connecting of parts such as truss tubes or constructing some part of the telescope is not a folding or sliding scope.

				<p>For example, here's my compact and easy to transport 6 inch. It's small enough to fit into the back seat of a small car with the rocker fitting over one end of the tube assembly. This scope stays fully assembled.<br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' src='FoldingScopes\MelBartelsCarryRFT.jpg'>

				<p>Here's a 6 inch scope that I took to Africa. The truss tubes come apart to fit into a backpack. It uses a single strut slide and pivot mount.<br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' src='FoldingScopes\MelBartelsBackpackScope.jpg'>

				<h3>What are some alternatives?</h3>

				<p>Travel scopes that pack tightly but take assembly time and effort. Typically one travels to a destination, assembles the scope and observes without further disassembly and re-assembly.

				<p>Here's Greg Babcock's 12 inch travel scope that he took to Argentina.<br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' src='FoldingScopes\GregBabcockTravelScope.jpg'>

				<h3>Why a folding scope?</h3>

				<p>A folding scope offers extreme ease of use, is quick to setup, is easy to setup, is lightweight and takes up less room (camping gear occupies a much greater volume). The usability of a scope is not a single factor. A standard truss dob disassembles and stacks into a smaller volume. But the assembly takes effort. The usability is a combination of several factors: lightweight * compact travel size * ease of setup * speed of setup * aperture * absence of ladder. A folding scope attacks several of these usability factors: compact travel size, ease of setup and speed of setup.

				<p>The Prime Directive is to connect to the universe, contemplate our place in it and the meaning of it all (spiritual), gather observations in pursuit of a scientific study. A high usability scope can make us feel more connected.

				<p>Whatever design we pick needs emotional appeal: it must be alive, not feel cold or dead.

				<p>The basic technical challenge is to squeeze air out of the telescope by folding or sliding itself into a much more compact space.

				<p>The design and building challenge? Iterate, grow by small changes, favor fewer number of simpler ideas, build on ideas of others, make it beautiful, be a creator and craftsman.

				<p>I judge telescope designs by asking, 'Is it more useful than before, is it more exciting than before?' In the end, I develop for myself. Perhaps others will find my designs worth looking at. I studied Origami for folding inspirations along with other fields, particularly engineered products like folding bicycles. My goal is to squeeze air out of the telescope.

			<div id='selectingTelescope'></div>
			<button class='accordion' id='btnSelectingTelescope'>Selecting a telescope</button>
			<div class='panel'>
				<p>Selecting a telescope is straightforward. Newtonians are the best value. Pick a focal length that you can handle. For your first telescope, make the focal length 48 inches [1.2m]. This is a good optimization between ergonomics (lifting, setting up, storing) and magnification (24/12/6mm eyepieces yield 50/100/200x, good for wide angle low power views and planetary high power views). Next select the aperture. Eight inches [20cm] is ideal, but 6 inches [15cm] to 10 inches [25cm] are acceptable.

				<p>I do not recommend binoculars as your primary optical tool. They do not have the magnification to show Saturn's rings nor the light grasp to nicely show deep-sky targets.

				<p>For your next scope, you can go wider angle and lower power to sweep the skies with a Richest Field Telescope (RFT), or go longer focal length with more aperture to capture more planetary detail and see more deep-sky objects.

				<p>If your interest is digital imaging, then the mounting and camera matter more than the optics. Select a nice quality small refractor. A combination like this will keep you busy for many years as you learn how to image and process your digital captures to perfection.

				<p>For ambitious telescope makers and observers, consider going F3. We know from observations that more aperture, even at low power, shows more than less aperture. Pick the focal length for the telescope that you can handle, e.g., 6 foot [1800mm] focal length to avoid a ladder, then select the largest fastest aperture you can make or purchase. For an F3, 6 foot [1800mm] that means a 24 inch [60cm] F3 primary. This telescope will give you the greatest etendue, or light flux, possible, given your eye's pupil. For higher magnification, we want to continue to maximize the etendue, so this means a longer focal length, larger F3 aperture. Similarly very low power at maximum etendue can be obtained through a F3 Richest Field Telescope, say 3-6 inches [76mm to 152mm] aperture. Changing magnifications to fit the object's size, we select from small, medium and large scopes. I call this 'telescope mode'. Eventually we will desire more magnification than we have aperture, so then we switch to 'eyepiece mode', where we use higher and higher power eyepieces as desired.

				<p>Alternatively, if your interest is exquisite planetary, lunar and double star viewing, consider selecting for the longest possible focal length you can manage, then select aperture to keep the focal ratio slow at F8 to F10. At this point you will no doubt be looking at more exotic optical designs, but the lowly Newtonian is indeed hard to beat at long focal ratios for the finest in planetary detail.

				<p>Mountings come in two flavors: altazimuth and equatorial. Some scopes can be set up either way. The altazimuth mount is oriented to the ground with left-right and up-down motions. This mounting is intuitive but needs to move slowly in both axes to track. And when tracking, suffers from field rotation. The equatorial mount is oriented to the sky with the primary axis pointed at the pole (in the northern hemisphere, very near Polaris). Tracking then consists of a slow constant motion in the primary or polar axis. It's easy to become confused during setup and motions near the pole are surprising.

				<p>You will also face a choice between manual push-to movements and motorized motions controlled by a computer. Push-to requires learning the placement of objects within constellations, star hopping from prominent stars. Computerized scopes will 'goto' the object for you. 'Goto' is especially useful in light polluted city skies where star hopping suffers from lack of starting stars and fainter constellations are harder to see. Star hopping also allows you to enjoy the scenery as you hop from star to star, viewing unexpected objects along the way though it can take considerable time to find a dim object.

				<p>Finally, there are two approaches to observing objects: visually through an eyepiece or capturing the object with a digital camera, processing the image later. There is a third new emerging choice, electronically assisted astronomy (EAA), that splits into a couple of choices: near real time observing by short exposure stacking and night vision (NV) observing. You can buy all-in-one electronic scopes too.

				<p>Never have amateurs had such a palette to choice from. It is bewildering, and challenging to buy quality equipment while staying within budget. A good idea is to join the local astronomy club; many amateurs are eager to share. And the local club may have a lending library where you can check out a telescope, perhaps even a digital camera.

				<p>Regional star parties are popular, usually located in dark skies, and often cater to families. You'll find an exciting range of amateurs and telescopes.

				<p>On a clear summer night, look up at the Milky Way. Gigantic clouds of innumerable stars form a stairway to heaven. But only with a telescope do these clouds reveal their true nature as first seen by Galileo: countless stars forming the spiral arms of our galaxy. <b>What aperture will show the greatest number of stars in

				<p>As you can see, a broad range of telescope sizes show close to the maximum number of stars. Therefore we say that <b>a telescope	used with a widest angle eyepiece that yield an exit pupil of 5-7mm	can be called a Richest Field Telescope - the richest field of stars possible in any single view</b>.

				<p><b>Most any telescope of F7 or faster with a two inch focuser and low power wide angle eyepiece can operate as a Richest Field Telescope.</b>

				<h3>A little history...</h3>

				<p>The idea was originally proposed by Mr. Walken in Knowledge (now Discovery) in 1916. He writes in part, 'My chief part was in perceiving and publicly pointing out how every aperture could be made 'an' RFT, of that aperture, for a given observer and that there was one of all these which, in connection with the curve of star density against magnitude of stars, was uniquely 'the' RFT for the observer, in respect of maximum countable number of star per apparent square degree.' He concludes, using star counts published in Knowledge, 1914, that a <b>2.5 inch</b> aperture has the greatest star count, though he goes on to say that the view through a <b>6 inch</b> is 'little inferior' and that the views through larger apertures 'is decidedly more attractive and 'richer.'' He calculated a star count of 423 given a 50 degree eyepiece. Incidentally, he concludes that a magnification that yields the maximum possible exit pupil is best: too low of magnification wastes light and too high of magnification narrows the field of view dropping the star count.

				<p>It's plausible that the table of star counts or density in 1914 set the stage to conceive of richest field telescopes. If so, then this is an example of information driven revolution. So perhaps we can set the origination date to 1915.

				<p>In 1936 an updated star count is used to revise the RFT aperture to <b>4 inches</b> with the count of stars as high as 711. Further discussion about the values of star density resulted in the conclusion that the RFT aperture is closer to <b>7 inches</b>. Finally there's a note that a brightened background due to the Moon (today, we sadly have to add light pollution) dramatically increases the optimum aperture perhaps to <b>10 to 12 inches</b>.

				<p>Clyde Tombaugh, discoverer of Pluto, built a <b>5 inch</b> RFT in 1935. Clyde describes the views as 'truly marvelous', mentioning how 'dark nebulae in Sagittarius stand[s] out beautifully, as it does on a moderate exposure photograph.' While Clyde extols the virtues of observing in Sagittarius, he says that the most beautiful and richest star fields are in the Cygnus region.

				<p>In a 1980 Sky and Telescope article, Glenn Shaw takes up the question of the best RFT aperture, using the latest star density values. He concludes that an aperture of <b>9 inches</b> is best though he employs a scope of <b>5 inches</b> aperture. He adds an interesting graph where only stars brighter than 5th magnitude in the eyepiece are counted. This favors apertures closer to <b>24 inches</b>. Since Glenn's numbers are the latest that I'm aware of, I use these, adjusted for wider angle eyepieces available today.

				<p>H.R. Suiter notes in 1996 that the best RFT aperture has varied from <b>1.5 inches to 12 inches</b> depending on revised star density values. Because of this to and fro with aperture, Suiter concludes that a rich-field telescope is best defined as one that can be used with an eyepiece yielding the maximum exit pupil that your eye can open to. He recommends personal experimentation since the aberrations of the eye are so substantial that star counts may not increase beyond 5 to 5.5 mm exit pupil. He makes an interesting comment that earlier observers would be awe struck by today's short focal ratio refractors and high quality high angle eyepieces, but that modern observers would envy earlier observers' dark skies even more!

				<p>One of the most successful commercial telescopes of all time is the Edmund Scientific Astroscan, a <b>4 inch</b> f4 wide field telescope. Norm Sperling, co-inventor, estimates that 90,000 units have been sold. Jerry Oltion built a double sized replica of <b>8 inches</b> aperture that garners considerable interest whenever it is setup.<br>

				<h3>How does a Richest Field Telescope work?</h3>

				<p>A Richest Field Telescope optimally balances aperture, field of view, magnification and star density to grab the greatest number of stars visible at any one time in the eyepiece.

				<p>We know that smaller telescopes and binoculars commonly have wider fields of view than large telescopes and binoculars. We know from experience at the telescope eyepiece that the lower the power, the wider the field (usually); the higher the power, the narrower the field. Why can't we continue to lower the power, increase the field of view in order to increase the number of stars visible at any single time? There seems to be a lower limit at work. <b>Why?</b>

				<p><b>The explanation lies in our eye's exit pupil.</b> Human eyes when dark adapted have a pupil size from 5mm to 9mm; 7mm being taken as an average. Here's <a href='pup_age from Lowenfeld in Topics in Neruo Ophthalmology by H S Thomson et al 1979.jpg' target='_blank'> a chart depicting exit pupil versus age</a>. All the light from the optics must fit into this 7mm opening, otherwise the light is wasted.

				<p><b>But what if we do waste light in this manner?</b> We do gain extra field by going to lower power. How does the extra field compare to the aperture the eye can use? The effective aperture is found by using the formula: lowest power magnification = 25.4 mm per inch /7 mm = 3.6x per inch of aperture ratio.

				<p>This formula is derived from:
					<br> magnification = telescope focal length * 25.4 / eyepiece focal length
					<br> magnification = telescope aperture * focal ratio * 25.4 / eyepiece focal length
					<br> magnification = telescope aperture * focal ratio * 25.4 / (focal ratio * 7mm exit pupil)
					<br> magnification = telescope aperture * 25.4 / 7mm exit pupil
					<br> magnification per inch of aperture = 25.4 / 7mm exit pupil = 3.6

				<p>If we lower our 3.6x per inch of aperture magnification by 1/3, the telescope's exit pupil increases from 7mm to 9mm. The aperture actually used by the eye decreases by 1/3. Our field of view increases in width by 1/3. It's as if we started with a telescope of 1/3 less aperture and used the 3.6x per inch of aperture magnification for that lowered aperture. So, we get the richest field possible for that lowered aperture. If we have a 9 inch telescope but instead of using it at 32x, we use it at 22x, then we get an effective aperture of 6 inches, and the corresponding wider field of view of a 6 inch rich field telescope. It's like having two richest field scopes in one! We cannot stretch these lowered magnifications and increasing exit pupils too far because our Newtonian diagonal shadow eventually becomes too large and because the physical size of the eyepieces, in order to maintain the wide apparent field of view, becomes too large and heavy and expensive.

				<p><b>What about increasing the magnification?</b> A complicating factor is the issue of magnification. With the unaided-eye at a dark sky site, the faintest stars visible are about 6.5 magnitude. But if we could use a telescope with the same aperture of the eye at greater than unit power, we would see stars down to 8 magnitude. How is this so? The increased magnification dims the sky background but does not dim the stars. The background glow is spread over a larger area thanks to the increased magnification. Spreading the same amount of light over a larger area dims it. Stars are not dimmed because they are point sources - so far away that no practical magnification can reveal their disks. The diffractive nature of light and turbulence in the atmosphere combined with instrument defects do enlarge a star's pinprick of light, but only extreme magnifications make this detectable. So, the blackened background enable us to see fainter magnitudes.

				<p>To achieve adequate sky background darkening, we need to magnify the view at least three times more. This is 1/9 as much field of view, consequently we must reach 9 times greater star count to stay even. Assuming star counts that stay roughly constant across varying aperture, we need to triple our effective aperture. On the other side, 1.5 magnitude deeper penetration (8 mag - 6.5 mag = 1.5 mag) computes to doubling the aperture or 4x greater star count. So, we fall short: doubling the aperture doesn't make up for the required tripling, or, 4x the number of stars doesn't make up for 1/9th the number of stars. Conclusion: use the lowest power possible.

				<p><b>Faint stars don't impress me.</b> Hmm, OK, then increase the aperture. The star count is about the same, but the stars will be brighter with larger aperture, the best aperture being broadly centered on 24 inches.

				<p><b>How about counting the total starlight, not just the star count?</b> Then the best views will be with the greatest aperture. The counts of the dimmest Milky Way stars do eventually bottom out: an aperture of 24-60 inches works best.

				<h3>Why smaller scopes?</h3>

				<p>While any aperture telescope with a low power wide angle eyepiece can operate as a Richest Field Telescopes, the smaller apertures are more popular. Reflectors are popular down to 4 inches [10cm] aperture, refractors tend to more more popular for smaller apertures and binoculars popular for the widest fields.

				<p>One reason that smaller apertures dominate is ergonomics. The Edmund sold 90,000 Astroscan telescopes in part for their ease of use and portability. Plop the scope down, point in the general direction and voila! If we compare fields of view, we can see another reason. Here are comparisons of 6, 10.5 and 13.2 inch apertures [15cm, 27cm and 34cm] set to their maximum possible fields (4.5, 2.5 and 1.8 degrees) given 100 degree eyepieces at a focal ratio of F3 of the North American Nebula, the Orion and Horsehead nebulae and the Lagoon and Trifid Nebulae.

				<p>You can see that the 10 and 13 inch aperture fields are not that dissimilar where as the 6 inch aperture has a much larger field.

				<h3>Mapping exit pupils to eyepiece focal lengths...</h3>

				<p>Here are the eyepiece focal lengths for different focal ratios and exit pupils. At the faster focal ratios, Newtonians need coma correctors. The TeleVue coma corrector multiples the focal ratio by 15%. Using this corrector alters the values.

				<h3>What else can a Richest Field Telescope do?</h3>

				<p><b>You've convinced me about stars, how about nebulae?</b> I understand that the greatest number of stars are seen with the largest exit pupil that my eye opens to. And that the star counts don't vary that much with common apertures. But I'm uncertain how best to view nebulae: lowest power, medium power, high power; more aperture, less aperture? We need satisfy two conditions: 1) that the nebula be recognizable and 2) that it be detectable.

				<p>For the nebula to be recognizable it has to fit substantially within the field of view. Consider perhaps the grandest nebula of all, our Milky Way Galaxy. Imagine looking skyward on a summer night from atop a ladder in field with distant horizons. Looking up at our galaxy overhead we imagine ourselves floating in space 30,000 light years from the monster black hole that dwells in its center. We imagine the unimaginably immense galaxy stretching out in front of us. Though we cannot sense it, we are spinning around the black hole at 150 miles per second. We can see the central hub peaking up and the giant spiral arms twisting in front of us. At a particular time in the spring, we can see the entire galaxy rim the horizon. It's impossible to make these wonderful observations using a high powered telescope pointed at a tiny fragment of our galaxy. So the nebula has to fit in the field of view to be distinguished.

				<p><b>How about showcase objects as examples?</b>

				<p><b>The Pleiades</b><br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' class='mediumSizeImage' src='dneb/PleiadesBubble.jpg'><br>
				I was astonished to see an irregular bubble of faint nebulosity surrounding the Pleiades, visible by virtue of the 4+ degree field of view and the 6 inches of aperture. Later it took me some time to find a deep digital image that showed the bubble as faint extensions of the Milky Way. Wow!

				<p><b>The Horsehead Nebula</b><br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' class='mediumSizeImage' src='dneb/Horsehead area 13 inch.jpg'>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' class='mediumSizeImage' src='drawings/Horsehead greater area 25 inch.jpg'> <br>
				The Horsehead is about 8x6 arcminutes in size but needs the nebulosity that it's embedded in to be framed, so let's say something closer to a half degree. An aperture close to 50 inches looks to be ideal. That we can see it in scopes as small as 5-6 inches and that we can see it nicely in 20+ inch scopes is a testament to our eyes. Before we pat ourselves too much on the back let's analyze the smallest aperture that we successfully detected the Horsehead. 5-6 inch aperture at 6mm exit pupil with a 70 degree eyepiece yields an apparent size close to 3 degrees, which matches our three degree apparent size rule from above!

				<p><b>The Milky Way</b> is full of bright and dark nebulae of all sizes. Telescopes of all apertures will give exciting views if they are used at large exit pupils and widest angle eyepieces. If aperture is smaller then the field of view will contain many Messier and NGC objects: the point being to observe the panorama taking in the surrounding nebulosity and stars. If the aperture is larger then the field may contain one or two objects: the point being to observe detail.

				<p><b>The faint supernova remnant G65.3 5.7 just north of Albireo</b><br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' class='mediumSizeImage' src='G65.3 5.7 north of Albireo.jpg'>

				<p><b>How about galaxies?</b><br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' class='mediumSizeImage' src='Markarian Chain 10.5 inch f2.7 2.5 FOV.jpg'>

				<p>Groupings of galaxies are beautiful through a Richest Field Telescope. With my 10.5 inch [27cm] f2.7 with 2.5 degree field scope, field after field is littered with galaxies; 5-20 galaxies in any field of view as I sweep through the Virgo / Coma Berenices region. The shapes of the galaxies can be dramatic as with NGC4565. I call this <b>'Richest Galaxy Observing'</b>.

				<p>By moving the scope around we create a larger virtual field of view, showing us surprising objects such as galactic cirrus or Integrated Flux Nebulae near M31. The 25 inch F2.6 telescope's low power field is 1.1 degrees, and by moving the scope I can create a virtual field that is several degrees wide.<br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' class='mediumSizeImage' src='drawings/M31 and clouds.jpg'>

				<p><b>Aren't RFTs meant for low power, have sloppy optics and produce poor high power views?</b>

				<p>Wide angle scopes are extremely challenging to design and build. Optical quality must be high, the difficulty of grinding fast mirrors is very high, alignment and focusing are far more critical and illuminating and baffling wide angle views are difficult. After dealing with F3 RFTs, building a F7 scope is 'easy-peasy'.

				<p>Particularly with medium apertures, I want my telescope to perform at <b>high powers</b> too. Tiny nebulae require it and glittering globular clusters are stunning when they fill the high power eyepiece. There is no compelling reason for <b>planetary viewing</b> to suffer. My 6' f/4 resolves the Galilean moons at 300x. It is an outstanding mirror, the focuser is high-end and the optical alignment perfect. Factors such as collimation and focusing accuracy are much tighter with a f/4 compared to a f/6. Notwithstanding, the <b>planetary views</b> through my 13.2' and 10.5' at 300x and 250x respectively are beautiful: razor-sharp with no scatter. Jupiter's recent triple-moon conjunction was memorable.

				<p><b>What about those large diagonals</b> that fast wide angle telescopes call for? First of all, slightly larger diagonal sizes do not significantly impact image quality, rumors to the contrary. Also, at f/4 and particularly at f/3, the illumination fall off, that is, how much does the light dim as you look towards the edge of the field, is very gradual. So, a diagonal size that fully illuminates only the center of the field will do nicely. My 13 inch f/3.0 RFT uses the same diagonal size as Coulter's original 13 inch f/4.5. An 18 inch scope calls for a diagonal to eyepiece distance of 12', and if the mirror happens to be a f/4, then a 3' diagonal will work fine. This is a diagonal to primary ratio of 6:1. At this ratio, image degradation due to the diagonal obstruction is practically insignificant.

				<h3>Observations and sketches...</h3>

				<p>Observing with the new RFTs have opened the door to sketches of very difficult faint objects: most surprising of all, Integrated Flux Nebulae.<br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' class='mediumSizeImage' src='drawings/Volcano IFN.jpg'>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' class='mediumSizeImage' src='drawings/CO Cam IFN.jpg'>

				<p><a href='Herschels Ghosts.html' target='_blank'>Here's my catalog of IFNs and the fascinating story of visual observations extending all the way back to William Herschel</a>.<br>
				<a href='drawings.html' target='_blank'>And check out my drawings...</a>.

				<h3>A final provocative thought...</h3>

				<p>Notice how the field of view is darker at higher magnifications? You can see more detail not only because the image is magnified but also because the background is darker. Do you ever stop the aperture down in order to darken the field at the given magnification? No?

				<p>Let's say you are observing Orion's Great Nebula, M42. And let's say that the magnification is set at say 100x. Would you choose a 6 inch scope with a darker background at this 100x or a 12 inch scope with a brighter background at 100x? Choose the 12 inch?

				<p>Then doesn't it follow that you should settle on a single eyepiece and a progression of apertures, say 6 inch, 12 inch and 24 inch?

				<p>The only question then is what is the optimum exit pupil which sets the background brightness in the field of view. Next time you observe with a Richest Field Telescope, see if you can experiment with stopping it down to a smaller aperture which gives you a smaller exit pupil. What exit pupil is best?

				<p>Now decide on a single eyepiece taking into account apparent field of view, eye relief, quality and price. Next settle on a focal ratio for your progression of telescopes. Now go out and buy or make telescopes to fill out the progression.

				<p>Observing an object then consists of setting up all three scopes, jumping back and forth between them based on optimal magnification and field size. Too onerous? Then consider a radical new telescope design where there are several apertures side by side, perhaps sharing a common focuser to be used with your eyepiece of choice.

				<p>I call this 'one eyepiece - many telescope' or 'telescope mode' as opposed to the universal 'many eyepieces - one telescope' or 'eyepiece mode'. Provocative? Jumping between differently sized RFTs while aimed at a single object is a compelling experience.

				<h3>Inspired by Richest Field Telescopes</h3>

				<p>A Richest Field Telescope, first proposed by Mr Walkin in 1916, is a telescope that could show the most stars in a field of view when pointed to the Milky Way. Since then the idea has broadened to telescopes that can provide low power, wide angle views. My F3 and faster RFTs with coma corrected 100 degree apparent fields of view make surprisingly low contrast objects visible.

				<p>What is going on? The concept of etendue best explains the new RFTs that I am calling 'HET's (High Etendue Telescopes).

				<h3>what is a HET (High Etendue Telescope)?</h3>

				<p>Imagine a water pipe. Etendue is the total amount of water flowing through the pipe. How can we get more water? Well, we can enlarge the pipe allowing more water to flow through and we can turn the valve on more to increase the flow of water. Enlarging the pipe is equivalent to increasing the apparent field of view while turning on the value more is equivalent to increasing aperture. Etendue is the amount of light flowing through the field of view into the eye.

				<p>To calculate etendue, use this simple formula: etendue = aperture squared * real field squared.

				<p>For example, a 12 inch f4 with a 21mm Ethos eyepiece has an etendue close to 1700 cm^2deg^2<br>
				where as a 12 inch f3 with the same eyepiece and coma corrector has a greater etendue close to 2200 cm^2deg^2.

				<p>The increased etendue allows me to see lower contrast objects. In dark skies with my High Etendue Telescopes I can get down to ~3% contrast (ratio of object+sky to sky). I have an <a href='NewtDesigner.html#visual' target='_blank'>object contrast calculator here</a>. And if the real field is held constant, then greater etendue allows me to see fainter stars.

				<p>Looking at the equation again, we see two factors that drive etendue: aperture and real field. Compared to a conventional RFT, a HET (High Etendue Telescope) has either increased aperture for the same field or increased field for the same aperture.

				<h4>Increasing etendue by increasing aperture</h4>

				<p>Here's an example of higher etendue by increasing aperture. The field on the left is with an 8 inch scope and the field on the right is with a 10 inch scope. Not only does the aperture increase the brightness and number of stars, but also every single point in the field of view receives more light with the 10 inch compared to the 8 inch.<br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' class='bigImage' src='Co Com etendue comparison.jpg'>

				<p>Another interesting way to look at it is to calculate the maximum aperture possible for different focal ratios given a field of view. The focal ratios are optimized for widest angle eyepieces.

				<p>field of view = 1.8 deg, eye pupil = 6mm

				<p>Going down to f/3.6, f/3.0 or f/2.5 means jumping up in aperture from 10 inches to 13 inches. In other words, what we could see previously with 8 inch scopes and wide angle Erfle eyepieces in the 1960's to 1990's and  with 10 inch scopes equipped with Naglers in the 1990's and 2000's is now seen with 13 inches aperture. This increase in aperture increases the limiting magnitude by a whole number.

				<p>A New Relationship: Maximum Aperture or Field of View Based on Varying Focal Ratio While Holding Eye Pupil Constant<br>
				<img alt=''	loading='lazy' src='ZipDob/ApertureVsFocalRatioVsFOV.gif'>

				<p>The impact of greater aperture for the same field of view is dramatic. Objects like the Horsehead, barely detectable in an 8 inch, are readily detectable in a 13 inch. Otherwise invisible galaxies pop into view. 	Instead of a faint object or two, many objects are visible at once.

				<h4>Increasing etendue by increasing field</h4>

				<p>Here is an example of higher etendue by increasing field. The first view is M51 the Whirlpool Galaxy through a 25 inch f5 telescope using a 31mm Nagler 82 degree eyepiece with etendue ~1400 cm^2deg^2 at an eye pupil of 6.2mm and true field of 0.76 deg, and the second with the same aperture of 25 inches but at f2.6 telescope using a 17mm Ethos 100 degree eyepiece and coma corrector with etendue ~2000 cm^2deg^2 at a slighter smaller eye pupil of 5.7mm and true field of 0.89 deg. You can see that the larger field with etendue growing from 2300 to 3200 gives a richer experience making the IFN boundaries easier to see.<br>

				<h3>Maximizing etendue</h3>

				<p>In designing a telescope that optimized for lowest power / widest angle observing, we may wish to calculate the focal ratio given a particular eyepiece and our eye's pupil. Here are two graphs, the last taking into account the TeleVue P2 coma corrector's magnification factor, that can be used to find the focal ratio that maximizes etendue.<br>

			<button class='accordion' id='btnCollimation'>Collimation</button>
			<div class='panel'>
				<p>Collimation, or optical alignment, is the act of bringing the eyepiece and focuser axis coincident with the primary mirror's axis.

				<p>It appears to be a little known consideration that, once aligned, rarely does the primary mirror need realignment. This because the diagonal holder invariable works lose. The key is to start by adjusting only the diagonal holder such that the eyepiece and focuser axis is once again coincident with the primary mirror's axis.

				<h4>The Andrew Angle</h4>

				<p>How many of you check your collimation with the telescope aimed vertically then with the telescope aimed horizontally? That's dynamic collimation, demanded by fast F5 and even faster F3 telescopes.

				<p>Notice a difference? That's bad news. The best one can do is to stiffen the telescope and aim it partway up the sky so that any drift in collimation is split between vertical and horizontal orientations. But what angle should be used? Andrew Bell has derived a formula for collimation error as a function of collimation angle that takes into account better seeing when the scope is aimed higher and proportion of sky that's observable from horizon to zenith. Mathematically, he used his formula to find a 'best' collimation angle that will minimize RMS collimation error as your telescope is pointed across the whole sky.

				<p>Andrew found that the optimal angle to collimate at is 48 degrees up from the horizon. He's also calculated that this is a broad answer in that a few degrees higher or lower gives very close to the same results.<br>

				<img alt='' loading='lazy' src='dynamic collimation/AndrewsDynamicCollimationAngle.jpg'>

				<p>In dynamic collimation, the scope is aimed at this angle (use an angle finder available from hardware stores) and collimated. Then check the collimation when the scope is aimed vertically and again when aimed horizontally. Verify that any dreaded collimation change is split between the two orientations. That's the best that can be done for the moment. If noticeable movement is found then stiffen the telescope structure including the diagonal holder and spider.

				<h4>Collimating</h4>

				<p>It's important to understand the single requirement of collimation, namely, that the eyepiece axis and primary mirror axis be co-incident, or on top of each other. Here we see the situation prior to collimating where both the diagonal and the primary mirror are out of adjustment.<br>

				<img alt='' loading='lazy' src='dynamic collimation/diagonal and primary not collimated.jpg'>

				<p>First the diagonal is brought into adjustment by making the laser beam point to the exact center of the primary. Closeup of laser centered in notebook ring that's carefully placed at the mirror's exact center.<br>

				<img alt='' loading='lazy' src='dynamic collimation/diagonal collimated.jpg'>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' src="collimateF3/centerdot.JPG">

				<p>Finally we adjust the primary mirror's collimation screws so as to aim the laser beam's return upon itself. Closeup of centered laser return.<br>

				<img alt='' loading='lazy' src='dynamic collimation/perfect collimation.jpg'>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' src="collimateF3/laserreturn.JPG">

				<p>For those using setting circles or computer control, the optical axis needs to be coincident or collimated with the mechanical axis, otherwise pointing and tracking errors occur.

			<p>Objects less than 3% contrast are pretty much impossible to see; objects 3-6% contrast can be seen as very faint with extended concentration; objects with greater than 6% contrast are increasingly easy to see. Objects less than several degrees in apparent size are more difficult to see. Use magnification to increase the apparent size, making the object easier to see. The contrast does not change. You can test this yourself in a darkened room. I combine the two factors together, contrast and apparent size, to predict likely detection of the object. The predicted level should be thought of more as a range, one level easier to one level harder. Factor in observer experience and vagaries of the object data, and the prediction becomes more fuzzy. This calculator also shows the relationship between object visibility and light pollution as expressed by the Bortle level (see below). It appears that it takes a significant gain in aperture to make a practical difference and that increasing light pollution drags down all apertures rather proportionally. For example, tripling the aperture is worth one to two Bortle levels.

				<p>The Greek astronomer Hipparchus in the 2nd century BC invented the  magnitude system where the brightest stars are of 1st magnitude and the dimmest are of 6th magnitude. I suspect that this system was in use beforehand: it’s common for humans to divide groups of things into sixes and it would have been natural for us to call the brightest stars “first class”.

				<p>The magnitude system is logarithmic not linear. This no doubt because our eyes work logarithmically (or at least semi-logarithmically). For example a star that is 1 magnitude brighter is 250% brighter; conversely a star that is 0.1 magnitudes dimmer is 10% dimmer.

				<p>The first lesson then is that we cannot get hung up on linear percentages instead we must think in logarithmic magnitudes. This is difficult because discussions today are almost universally in percentages which is completely misleading. Illumination drop-off at the edge of the eyepiece? Stated in percentages (e.g. 15% sounds terrible) should be in magnitudes (e.g. 0.06 mag unnoticeable visually). Mirror coating reflections? Stated in percentages (e.g. 92%) are better stated in magnitudes (e.g. 0.04 mag loss). It is very difficult to see differences of 0.2 magnitude or less. And when the view is dimmed both object and background are equally dimmed leaving the contrast unchanged. Unless the view is grossly dimmed the unchanging contrast means that the object does not lose visibility. I will be using magnitudes just as charts and observing manuals.

				<p>What is sky glow brightness? The night sky even at very dark sites glows faintly due to zodiacal light and airglow. See Brian Skiff's discussion at <a href='http://www.astropix.com/HTML/L_STORY/SKYBRITE.HTM' target='_blank'>http://www.astropix.com/HTML/L_STORY/SKYBRITE.HTM</a>. You can measure the darkness (or brightness) of your night using a sky glow meter available at <a href='http://unihedron.com/projects/darksky/' target='_blank'>http://unihedron.com/projects/darksky/</a>. Dark sky sites have readings close to 21.5 magnitudes per square arcsecond. Observing through a telescope with your eye's pupil fully opened results in a skyglow in the field of view equal to that of the night sky. Magnifying the image results in smaller exit pupils the useful maximum magnification or smallest exit pupil being close to 1mm.The sky glow brightness drops more than 4 magnitudes to close to 26 magnitude as exit pupil shrinks to 1mm.

				<p>For extended objects things are not as simple as stars. For starters it is not possible to increase the surface brightness of an extended object by increasing the aperture. An example: take an object of 10 magnitude/ square arcsecond as seen by the unaided eye at night exit pupil open to 7mm. Now look at the object through a 10' scope. If there is no magnification to the image the surface brightness will increase by the ratio of the scope's aperture to the eye's aperture squared or (10'/0.3')^2 =~ 1000x. However in order to fit all of the light from the 10' aperture into the eye's exit pupil we must use at least 33x. 33x will dilute the image brightness by 33^2 =~ 1000x so we are back where we started. In fact because of mirror coatings not reflecting 100% and the small obstruction caused by a diagonal the image brightness per area will actually be a little less than with the unaided-eye.

				<p>This leads to the interesting conclusion that the brightness of the sky glow as seen in the eyepiece is entirely dependent on exit pupil. At a given location on a given night no matter the size of scopes if they are giving the same exit pupil then the sky glow brightness will be very similar.

				<p>Fifty years of observing deep-sky objects has shown that there is a strong correlation between contrast and object detectability. For an experienced observer a contrast of 6% makes for an easy detection while a contrast of 2.5-3% is quite difficult; contrast less than 2.5% is pretty much impossible. Interestingly, the object needs to be at least several degrees in apparent size for best detection results.

				<p>How well does the object's integrated magnitude match the object's surface brightness and size? I studied the Saguaro Catalog. The standard deviation between integrated and calculated magnitude is 1.3 magnitudes. So I use a 2 magnitude band to predict visual detectability when given an integrated magnitude. The following chart is based on my decades of observing experience using scopes up to 40 inches [1M] in size:<br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' src='VisualDetectionLimits.jpg'>

				<p>Notice that the lines are banded or thickened. You might fall slightly above or below these bands based on the factors discussed earlier. Beware of anyone or any calculator that states overly precise limiting magnitudes. These are at best guides and give a false impression that an object is either perfectly visible or perfectly invisible. Objects on the edge of visibility come in and out of view over a period of time. One night that object might be visible three times in a half hour (my standard for detectability). On another night it simply is completely invisible. On rare perfect nights not only can I detect it much of the time but there is detail too. Also if the galaxy or cluster or planetary is unusually large then the detection limit will suffer. Note that as aperture increases minor differences (say between a 20 inch and a 22 inch telescope) become insignificant even undetectable except for rare edge cases.

					<li><b>Stars</b>, or point sources. A star's visibility depends on aperture: the telescope's light gathering power. Higher powers darken the field, increasing contrast and making the faintest stars more visible. Since the star is a point source, magnification does not affect its brightness. However, poor seeing that ruins high power viewing will make faint stars harder to see.<br><br>

					<li><b>Open clusters</b>. Large apparent size clusters are usually bright so less aperture and wider field of view is ideal.<br><br>

					<li><b>Globular clusters</b>. It is all about aperture, not only in terms of the fainter members of bright clusters and brighter stars of faint clusters but also in resolution. Larger aperture also allows for greater magnification, making the cluster larger in the eyepiece.<br><br>

					<li><b>Galaxies and clusters of galaxies</b>. Aperture can be used to bring in detail with good magnification for bright galaxies; aperture also dominates for the vast majority of galaxies which are faint and small. Galaxy clusters need all the aperture that can be mustered. For the largest galaxy clusters, Virgo and Perseus, for example, lower power wider angle fields of view that show more galaxies (Richest Field Galaxy Observing) need to be balanced with higher power narrower fields that reveal the faintest galaxy members.<br><br>

					<li><b>Small sized nebulae</b>. Small scopes at low power can reveal smaller sized nebulae; larger scopes at higher power reveal detail. Nebula filters can help significantly. Dark skies are important.<br><br>

					<li><b>Wide angle nebulae</b>. Wider angle eyepieces help to frame the wide angle nebula with a black border. Experienced observers will find that nebulae with surface brightness down to three magnitudes fainter than sky background easy (6% contrast); nebulae four magnitudes fainter than sky background (3% contrast) is close to the limit.<br><br>

			<button class='accordion' id='btnVisualHowToLookThroughEyepiece'>How to look through an eyepiece</button>
			<div class='panel'>
				<p>After reading horrifying advice on forums on how to look through an eyepiece, I guess I need to talk about this subject.

				<p>Your eye needs to be centered over the eyepiece and looking down its axis. You also need to position your eye above the eyepiece at the correct distance. Some eyepieces come with a rubber cup that places your eye at the correct spacing above the eyepiece. You can look up the eye relief spec for the eyepiece to get a guide. In the field move your eye away and towards the eyepiece. Slowly move your eye inward until you can see the field stop - the black edge of the field of view.

				<p>Unless you have astigmatism, look without glasses. Refocusing the eyepiece will take care of near and far sighted eyes. In fact, try to position the eyepiece as far outward as possible. To do this, move the eyepiece outward such that the stars look out of focus. Now slowly move the focuser inward until the stars just come to focus. This is the most relaxed, infinity focused position for your eye. Moving the focuser inward results in a slightly more magnified view, but at the expense of focusing your eye close-in, which is tiring.

				<p>Averted vision works best if you know where to aim your eyes in the field of view. Here's a chart to help.<br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' id='Graphic1' name='Graphic1' src='avertvis.gif'>

				<p>Move your averted vision zone around the field of view as you desire. Look for a bit here, look for a bit there (your scan pattern), as the objects in the field need. Do not try to fixate on the center of the field! For one thing, this mis-places the zone of averted vision towards the bottom of the field, for another thing, it is not possible to prevent the eye from moving. Several times a second, your eye jumps (a saccade). Between these jumps the eye gathers information. Even between saccades, the eye is jittering. Finally, if you stare too long as a single point, objects will literally begin to disappear from your view. Finally, move the scope in addition to your eye: this helps to 'pop' objects into conscious visibility.

				<p>One more bit of advice. Eye shields that block extraneous light, even natural dark-sky light, are amazingly effective. Here's an example:<br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' src='osp01/chuck-shield.jpg'>

				<p>Oh, and yet one more bit of advice: look down at the dark ground as much possible - your night vision is affected deleteriously by looking up at the sky for too long of periods of time.

			<div class='panel'>
				<p>What magnifications should be used? I favor three strategies both based on exit pupil (the eyepiece's focal length in mm divided by the telescope's overall focal ratio [e.g. 24mm eyepiece on a F/6 scope produces a 4mm exit pupil]):

				<p>The first is based on Richard Berry's advice. Arrange your eyepieces so that they give exit pupils as following:<br>
				5-7mm Richest Field observing<br>
				3-5mm best deep sky observing<br>
				1-2mm best detailed observing (globulars planetaries lunar and planetary)

				<p>The second is based on Stephen O'Meara's comments (e.g. his Herschel 400 Observing Guide). He uses modest aperture (4 inches [10cm]) at low medium and high powers. He takes his time studying the object carefully at each power. His low medium and high exit pupils are:<br>
				4.4mm<br>
				1.4mm<br>
				0.96mm<br>
				If you are wondering who to look to for observing advice pay attention to the top observers who use smaller scopes like O'Meara.

				<p>The third is a strategy that I've developed in response to the super wide angle eyepieces available today. It allows me to see large scale objects otherwise too big for a given scope. I call this strategy “framing” or “composing” the view where the object is magnified to fill the eyepiece’s field of view as much as possible with a nice border around it for contrast. Increasing the apparent object size beyond this 'cut-off' results in a less pleasing more difficult view. Here the widest possible field of view is important even at the cost of more glass for the light to pass through. In this approach I smoothly decrement the exit pupil. I use a set of exit pupils as follows (note thatthe typical set of eyepieces does not fit nicely):<br>
				5-6mm for largest scale objects<br>
				3-4mm for medium scale objects<br>
				1-2mm for small scale objects<br>

				<p>Very wide fields of view at widest exit pupils allow for more aperture for a given field and also increased detail because the objects are spread out more. For more on this check out my <a href='The New Sub-F3 Richest Field Telescopes.html' target='_blank'>'Why Am I Seeing More'</a> page.

			<div class='panel'>
				<p>I've been enthusiastically observing for a number of decades. Here are the factors that influence what I can see that night through the eyepiece of my telescope.

				<ul>
					<li>Focal length gives you scale; it's important to understand the role of magnification.
					<li>Aperture increases visibility and detail not only because of greater light gathering power but also because the greater magnification brings the object in closer.
					<li>Seeing the object in a larger scope then returning immediately to your smaller scope can result in a half magnitude gain.
					<li>Observer experience is worth 2 magnitudes (I have a series of sketches of M31 from childhood onward showing my increasing ability to see).
					<li>Observer variation is a half magnitude or more.
					<li>Age matters a magnitude: young kids can see very faint stars; as we get older our lens yellows and ability to detect fades.
					<li>Knowing where to look and what to look for worth a magnitude.
					<li>Averted vision is worth a magnitude.
					<li>Dark adaption continues to produce increasing benefits for hours ultimately worth maybe a half a magnitude.
					<li>Field baffling is an overwhelming factor: the difference between nonexistent and fully baffled views can be worth magnitudes.
					<li>Covering your head with a black cloth also yields improvements perhaps on the order of a fraction of a magnitude.
					<li>Time at the eyepiece is worth a magnitude (objects gradually become recognizable or detectable over a period of time and then they fade after a prolonged period of continuous observing).
					<li>Comfort at the eyepiece is worth a half magnitude.
					<li>Rested eyes are worth half a magnitude. I often take short breaks throughout the night. Upon returning to the eyepiece I can see more until my eyes tire.
					<li>Sky transparency is such an overwhelming factor; on rare perfect nights I’ve seen scopes perform as if they had almost unlimited aperture; let’s call superb sky transparency worth a magnitude or two.
					<li>Filters are worth a magnitude.
					<li>Visibility appears to correlate most with aperture then apparent size (the greater the aperture the greater the apparent size limited by the full field of view).
					<li>True binocular or two eyed viewing results in a half magnitude gain in stellar limiting magnitude and about a magnitude gain for extended objects.

			<div id='visualTipsImproveObserving'></div>
			<button class='accordion' id='btnVisualTipsImproveObserving'>Tips to improve observing</button>
			<div class='panel'>
				<p>My tips are different from the usual run of the mill lists because I have found that improving myself, not obsessing over the telescope, the key to deeply satisfying sessions at the eyepiece.

				<p>I have found three factors, in order of importance:
				<ol>
				  <li>The observer</li>
				  <li>The skies</li>
				  <li>The telescope especially ergonomics and filters</li>
				</ol>
				<p><img alt='' loading='lazy' src='ScopeTelescopeSkyTriad.jpg'>

				<p>I've seen too many cases where an experienced observer sees more from urban skies than a beginner from dark skies. I've seen too many cases where the telescope is blamed when the problem lay with the observer or the skies.

				<p>Let's dispense with<b> the myth that aperture makes all the difference</b>. One of the greatest observers of all time, Stephen O'Meara, uses a 5 inch [13cm] telescope. I've seen expert observers work their magic with telescopes regardless of the telescope's aperture and quality. I've never seen an increase of aperture turn a so-so observer into a great observer. I have witnessed amateurs regrettably leave the hobby after quickly jumping up in aperture or purchasing expensive high-end telescopes, their dreams unfulfilled. A common progression goes like this: entry level middle of the road scope, then a larger aperture scope followed ultimately by the realization that aperture does not make the observer followed by stirring a smaller scope into the mix. Advanced amateurs favor telescopes optimized for their favorite objects: giant telescopes for clusters of galaxies, long focal ratio scopes for lunar and planetary, very portable scopes for traveling to dark skies.

				<p>To an experienced observer,<b> transparency is everything</b>. A wonderfully transparent night renders aperture insignificant. Every telescope becomes a winner on an exceptional night. Use weather forecasts along with Clear Sky Clock to target those transparent nights. Learn to look for signs of excellent transparency during the daytime such as blue sky right up to the edge of the Sun (mask the Sun with your hand), jet trails (the trails should be short, not stretching across the sky, indicating a dry upper atmosphere), and clear sunsets and sunrises.

				<h4>Here are my top tips.</h4>

				<ol>
					<li>Remove the <b>lens cap</b>. Seriously. It's happened to the best of us, leaving a stop-down off-axis mask in place all night, wondering why the views are dim, wondering why that object cannot be found.<br><br>

					<li>Overcome your <b>cognitive biases</b>. Most amateur beliefs about telescopes and observing result from bias, are simply not true, and seriously limit your observational results.<br><br>

					<li><b>Observe, observe, observe. </b>There is no substitute for hours at the eyepiece. How often do you observe a week? What can you do to increase your observing hours? Make the telescope more portable, join others observing. Aim to observe one to two times a week on average. Malcolm Gladwell's book, "Outliers", states that thousands of hours of practice are necessary to become an expert. How many hours do you think that Stephen O'Meara has observed? How many have you?<br><br>

					<li><b>Keep an observing notebook.</b> Sketch, sketch, sketch. It's not about the drawing as much as it is about your skills to notice detail. Study the objects ahead of time. Locate them on a planetarium sky chart and note how best to star hop to them.<br><br>

					<li><b>Dark adapt your eyes and work to keep them dark adapted.</b> Use an eyepiece shroud or equivalent. A variable brightness dim light flashlight makes a big difference. And set your planetarium programs on tablets to night mode along with red or green covers that further dim the light.<br><br>

					<li>Learn <b>how to use your eyepieces</b>. Ever watch attendees at public star parties use your scope for the first time? They move their eye around searching for the field, in and out, left and right, up and down. You too need to learn how to position your eye and how to observe the field of view for each eyepiece. If you must use glasses then be sure to pick eyepieces with sufficient eye relief.<br><br>

					<li><b>Take time at the eyepiece for each object.</b> <b>More time spent observing an object is like increasing the aperture and resolution of your telescope!</b><br>
					<img alt='' loading='lazy' src='MoreTimeObservingMeansMorePowerfulScope.jpg'><br>
					A few minutes brings awareness to detail that's thrilling and satisfying but do not stop there. More awareness and detail comes after observing for an hour or more on an object. The most difficult objects are only there 20% to 50% of the time. The seeing will stabilize and your concentration will be at your peak with your eyes paying attention to the proper place in the field for a few moments. My personal standard is that I have to see the object or detail in question three times over a 20 minute session to say that I 'saw it'. Observe for yourself. The vast majority of observers are truthful to themselves, knowing or not caring that they will fail to convince doubters. It's all subjective. Look at sketches by observers. Each observer tends to notice or emphasize certain features. They can invariably be traced back to digital images, to reality. I study digital images ahead of time, to get a sense of detail that might be glimpsed. If I see it, great; if I don't, that's great too. Knowing that it is beyond my observational powers is worthwhile too. I certainly add the negative results to my lists of "impossibles" to go after on those rare nights of perfect transparency when I find myself under the darkest skies.<br><br>

					<li><b>Get a dark sky or nebula filter.</b> These filters really help to make subtle detail more noticeable. A filter is more important than aperture because a nebula filter increases contrast more so than aperture.<br><br>

					<li><b>What can you do to increase comfort at the eyepiece?</b> A better observing chair, rotating the focuser to a better viewing angle, a small table next to you for your eyepiece case, tool chest and tablet, eyepiece cases that make it easy to retrieve and swap eyepieces. Use a checklist for your gear. I have a couple of checklists, one for short trips and one for longer multi-night star parties.<br><br>

					<li><b>Try different eyepieces, try different filters.</b> Walk away for a minute then return to the eyepiece. Aim the scope at different points in the field of view. Test your exit pupil by using your lowest power eyepieces. Calculate the exit pupil of the telescope-eyepiece by dividing the eyepiece's focal length in mm by the scope's focal ratio, e.g., a 20mm eyepiece used with a F5 telescope gives an exit pupil of 20/5 = 4mm. Defocus slightly to see if you can see the primary mirror's edge (hint: look for the edge clips). If so then your eye covers that exit pupil. Borrow lower power eyepieces from friends until you find your eye's limit. You may be surprised by how big of exit pupil you can use.<br><br>

					<li>Consider the interplay between <b>aperture, magnification, apparent field of view and exit pupil</b>. Aperture sets star brightness and magnification along with field size given a standard set of eyepieces. Magnification sets the image scale. Apparent field of view sets the overall width of the field. Some like wide fields, others like narrow fields. Eyepieces designed for wide fields perform slightly differently than narrow field eyepieces. Finally, exit pupil sets background brightness. <br><br>

					<li><b>Drink water during the night, rest your eyes periodically</b>, don't strain your eyes during the daytime with bright light - instead use good sunglasses, have snacks on hand to fight off tiredness and dress warmly in layers.<br><br>

					<li><b>Attend observing oriented star parties like the Oregon Star Party.</b> Talk to the top observers (like Chuck and Judy Dethloff and Howard Banich) and read their writings. Usually in their introductory comments and occasionally while talking about their observations, they will mention what they do to improve their observations. Read their comments a second time and then a third time.<br><br>

					<li><b>Find dark skies. </b>Enough said.<br><br>

					<li><b>Baffling is the single greatest improvement that you make to your telescope.</b> Improve the telescope's baffling until you cannot detect any glare through your eyepieces from a flashlight aimed at various angles at the telescope by a friend. Most important are the focuser baffle, the diagonal baffle and the primary mirror baffle.<br><br>

					<li><b>Optical alignment or collimation.</b> Keep it simple: precisely center dot your primary with a notebook ring, use a good laser collimator to adjust the secondary until the laser points exactly in the center of the primary (rotate the laser to confirm that there is no wobble or angle to the laser), finally adjusting the primary so that the return beam coincides with the start of the laser beam.<br> <br>

					<li>Add <b>tracking</b> to your telescope if the field of view is under a degree. Motorize the equatorial mount, computerize and motorize the altazimuth mount, or place your telescope on an equatorial platform.<br><br>

					<li><b>Cooling the primary mirror to the night time ambient temperature.</b> A 0.1 degree difference within the primary mirror amounts to a tenth wave error.<br><br>

					<li><b>A precision focuser with a two stage knob,</b> particularly if the focal ratio is very short. The zone of good focus on a F3.0 mirror is a thousandth of an inch.<br><br>

					<li>Advanced observers should consider a <b>second telescope specialized</b> for their interests.
				</ol>

				<p>What about the endless myopic discussions on internet forums? I offer one word of advice:<b> pay attention to experienced telescope makers who are also experienced observers</b>. Two joys await the amateur astronomer: making a telescope then using it to view the heavens. Each telescope made is a departure from the previous telescope as the maker applies hard won lessons to satisfy desires. Lessons learned at the eyepiece by the telescope maker are lessons of hard truth. Search out these people as they are often busy observing and building.

				<p>What about exquisite optical quality and high end equipment? It's natural to want the best; we all strive for it, but will it magically endow you with hundreds of hours of observing time? At star parties I tend to gravitate to <b>the humble observer with the used looking telescope, maybe a bit scuffed up from many nights of use, with optics of decent quality</b>. For example, thanks to the Denomination Bias, amateurs will pay much more money for a 1/12 wave mirror than a 1/8 wave mirror, yet the difference between these two ratings is far smaller (three times smaller) than the difference between 1/4 wave and 1/8 wave, a difference in some cases that is worthwhile.

				<p>It helps to have an observing program and plan your evening's viewing. <a href='http://www.astroleague.org/observing.html' target='_blank'>The Astronomical League has a number of observing plans</a>. Or create your own i.e. comparing the shapes of globular clusters in the Sagittarius region or colorful double stars in Bootes. Use a table for your eyepieces tools charts and texts or for your tablet and lightshield. Plan on 20 minutes per object. I strongly encourage you to sketch what you see. This hones your observing skills and brings out details in the object. Observe at all three ranges of power: low medium and high.

			<h4>Definitions</h4>

			<b>True field of view</b> is the angle of the sky as seen through the eyepiece when used with the telescope.<br>
			<b>Eyepiece focal length</b> is the distance from the entrance of the eyepiece (where the parallel rays of light begin to converge) to its focal point.<br>
			<b>Eyepiece field stop</b> is the entrance to the eyepiece (ring inside the barrel) that limits the apparent field.<br>
			<b>Eye pupil</b> is the diameter of the opening of the eye's iris.<br>
			<b>Resolution</b> is the limit to discern detail, e.g., a double star or lunar feature.<br>
			<b>Magnitude limit</b> is the faintest star that can be seen given the aperture and magnification.<br>
			<b>Etendue or luminance</b> is the flux or total light flowing into the eye. Values are in cm^2deg^2 (either: area _of_aperture * area_of_true_field, or, area_of_pupil * area_of_eyepiece_apparent_field)<br>
			<b>Coma or comatic aberration</b> is the distortion of off-axis detail due to the primary mirror's paraboloidal shape,, i.e., stars appear to have a tail or coma.

			<div id='exitPupil'></div>
			<button class='accordion' id='btnExitPupil'>Exit pupil</button>
			<div class='panel'>
				<p>The exit pupil, sometimes called the Ramsden disc, is the disc of light that floats above an eyepiece. You can see this circle of light when the scope is pointed at a bright sky. This is where the eye should be placed for viewing through the eyepiece. The exit pupil is the real image of the primary mirror formed by the eyepiece and is also the virtual aperture: only light that passes through this disc can be seen by the eye. The exit pupil is found by dividing the eyepiece focal length by the focal ratio of the primary mirror, for example, a 30mm eyepiece with an F5 mirror produces a 6mm exit pupil.

				<p>Wider exit pupils are associated with lower power and brighter fields; narrow exit pupils with high power and dimmer fields. Be careful not to confuse the size of the exit pupil with the apparent field of view. Using the example above with a F5 mirror, a 30mm eyepiece with apparent field of view of 40 degrees produces the same exit pupil as a 30mm eyepiece with 80 degrees apparent field of view. However, the 80 degree apparent field eyepiece will produce 4x the light flux or etendue compared to the 40 degree apparent field of view eyepiece.
			</div>

			<br><br>
			<div id='etendue'></div>
			<button class='accordion' id='btnEtendue'>Etendue or luminance</button>
			<div class='panel'>
				<p>Etendue or luminance is the flux gathering capability of the telescope. The greater the aperture and the greater the true field of view, the greater the luminance, or light flowing through the telescope. Luminance is simply the mirror's area in centimeters squared times the true field's area in degrees squared (cm^2deg^2). A difference of 20% is probably the minimally meaningful change. There is room to improve luminance in popular amateur telescope designs.

				<p>Since the eye's pupil also forms an aperture, luminance can also be calculated by the eye pupil's area in cm^2 times the area of the eyepiece's apparent field in degrees^2 (cm^2deg^2). From this perspective we see that luminance is ultimately limited by only two factors: the eye's pupil and the eyepiece's apparent field of view.

				<p>In designing a telescope that optimized for lowest power / widest angle observing, we may wish to calculate the focal ratio given a particular eyepiece focal length and our eye's pupil. The focal ratio that maximizes etendue (luminance) should be the same as the focal ratio of the eyepiece and eye which equals the eyepiece focal length / eye pupil; further divided by any coma corrector magnification factor.

				<p>Here are two graphs, the last taking into account the TeleVue P2 coma corrector's magnification factor, that can be used to find the focal ratio that maximizes etendue.<br>

			<div id='magnification'></div>
			<button class='accordion' id='btnMagnification'>Some thoughts on magnification</button>
			<div class='panel'>
				<p>A range of magnifications is key to using a telescope properly.

				<p><b>Magnification</b> is the ratio of the apparent size to actual size of an object. For example, looking through a magnifying lens the spider appears three times bigger. That's a magnification of 3x.

				<p>Magnification depends on <b>telescope focal length</b> and <b>eyepiece focal length</b>. <b>Calculate magnification</b> by dividing the telescope focal length by the eyepiece focal length. For example, a 6 inch or 15cm telescope of 48 inches focal length used with a 9mm eyepiece yields a magnification of 48 inches * 25.4mm per inch / 9mm = 135x.

				<p><b>Astronomical objects</b> are very far away and very faint. Both magnification and aperture are needed to view and image objects.

				<p>Astronomical objects are either <b>point sources</b> like stars, too small in diameter to ever be resolved in a telescope, or <b>extended sources</b> like nebulae.

				<p>There is a <b>practical limit</b> to both lowest magnification and highest magnification.

				<p>The <b>lowest magnification</b> is simply the ratio of the telescope's aperture to the eye's dark adapted pupil. The lowest possible magnification for a 6 inch or 15cm aperture is 6 inches * 25.4mm/inch / 7mm eye-pupil = 22x.

				<p>A useful <b>highest magnification</b> is the magnification where the eye's resolving power is fully utilized. A telescope's resolution is limited by interference caused by the aperture. The interference creates a disk of light surrounded by ever fainter rings of light. The radius of this Airy Disk is ~ 1.2 times the wavelength of light divided by the aperture. For a 6 inch or 15cm aperture scope the Airy Disk is 0.75 arc-seconds. The eye can resolve 120 arc-seconds. The magnification that matches the eye's resolution to the telescope's resolution is 120 arc-seconds divided by 6 inches aperture or roughly 27x per inch of aperture (roughly 68x per cm of aperture).

				<p>Some observers prefer up to <b>twice this amount</b> so that the eye isn't strained (54x per inch of aperture or 136x per cm of aperture).

				<p>Magnification above this is termed <b>empty magnification</b>: the object is made larger but nothing more can be resolved. In certain cases such as double star observing increasing magnification above this amount makes measuring the separation between the stars easier, but otherwise the image becomes softer, fuzzier and displeasing to the eye.

				<p>Shimmering in the atmosphere, called <b>seeing</b> also limits magnification. If the jet stream is overhead or the upper atmosphere otherwise disturbed, magnification can be limited to 250x regardless of aperture. Steadier nights allow for increased magnification. The number of nights where 500x or higher can be employed are few and highly prized by observers. Nights where 2000x and higher can be used come very rarely. For example see <a href='6000X.html' target='_blank'>The Night of 6000x at the 1997 Oregon Star Party</a>. For more on seeing and the atmosphere, see my article on <a href='NewtDesigner.html#turbulence' target='_blank'> atmospheric turbulence</a>.

				<p><b>Stars</b> (other than our Sun) are so far away that they are not resolvable regardless of magnification. They remain point sources. Extended objects (Moon, Sun, planets, nebulae, galaxies), however, are resolvable. As magnification increases, their light is spread over a larger area, decreasing brightness at any single point. The Moon, Sun and planets are so bright that increasing magnification doesn't consign them to invisibility. <b>Nebulae and galaxies</b> are a different matter.

				<p>Let's use the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy' target='_blank'>Andromeda Galaxy</a>, visible as an elongated smear in dark skies to the unaided-eye. It's about 3x1 degrees apparent size with an integrated or overall magnitude of 3.5. The galaxy has an average surface brightness of 22.2 magnitudes per arc-second square. Let's use our 6 inch, 15cm, aperture at lowest magnification of 22x. At 22x the Andromeda Galaxy now appears 66x22 degrees in size and will comfortably fit within a 80 degree field of view eyepiece. The telescope brightens the galaxy by the ratio of the square of the telescope's aperture to the eye's aperture, or (6 inches of aperture * 25.4 mm/inch / 7mm eye-pupil) squared or 484 times. But the magnification of 22x decreases the object's brightness by the identical 484 times amount, leaving the apparent average surface brightness unchanged at 22.2 magnitudes per arc-second. Yet the view through the 6 inch is immeasurably richer. Why?

				<p>Balancing aperture with magnification is as if a rocket ship takes us 22 times closer. We see more detail and the object overall is much brighter. But fly too close and the eyepiece can no longer fit the object into the field of view. Using the same telescope at increasing magnification means more detail at the cost of brightness. See my comparison of the Sombrero Galaxy, M104, with 6 inch and 13 inch telescopes at <a href='NewtDesigner.html#comparingAperture' target='_blank'> is aperture king?</a>

				<h4>Table of lowest and highest magnifications per aperture.</h4>

				<p>Lowest magnification is given for 7mm and 5mm pupils, older people's eyes being closer to 5mm. Magnifications greater than 250x may be limited by seeing conditions.

				<h4>Choosing magnification and aperture.</h4>

				<p><b>Three examples</b>...

				<p><b>Saturn</b>. Since Saturn is a planet, select for highest useful magnification for your telescope, given seeing conditions. For example at my home, some of time I can I am limited to 250x, sometimes I can get up to 500x, occasionally I can reach 1000x before the image turns fuzzy thanks to seeing.

				<p><b>North American Nebula</b>. The NAN is an extended wide field object, spanning 120 arc-minutes.

				<p>Compute the highest magnification such that the entire object plus a border fits into the eyepiece. For this we need to know your eyepiece's apparent field of view.

				<p><b>Dumbbell Nebula</b>. This planetary nebula is a favorite of observers. Its size is about 8 arc-minutes. Enter its size in the calculator above. The calculator will give a value of 240x-600x depending on the eyepiece's apparent field of view. The calculator will also give an aperture value far greater than your telescope. In this situation, use the largest aperture you have, setting its magnification to the calculated amount.

				<p>If the object is too faint, then use a slightly lower magnification. If the object is too fuzzy because of turbulence in the atmosphere or perhaps because the telescope is performing poorly, then lower the magnification. Be careful to not over-magnify the object such that it overfills the field of view. This can cause a faint object to disappear.

				<p>Here is a <b>table of magnification and aperture for objects of different size</b>. The aperture is based on a 7mm eye pupil. For 5mm eye pupil, increase magnification by 1.4 and decrease aperture by 1.4. Magnifications greater than 250x may be limited by seeing conditions.

				<p><b>The strategy</b> is to select the highest magnification that frames the object in the eyepiece's field of view, subject to seeing conditions and telescope capabilities. Then select the largest aperture available. Starting with a given aperture, select for the highest magnification that frames the object, subject to seeing. If the object is invisible, then try a lower magnification. This rarely happens. Much more common is a failure to properly frame the object. Use filters, go to dark skies and improve your observational skills.

				<p>Should you ever select for <b>less aperture</b>? That's equivalent to stopping down the aperture to improve the view. Stopping down by using an off-axis mask to reduce the deleterious effects of bad seeing helps. Stopping down to improve deep-sky views does not help. While objects can be detected at diminished apertures, there is a general loss of detail. See my results at <a href='Is Aperture King.html'>Is aperture king?</a>

				<p>As long as you can select for the largest aperture, you are in <b>telescope mode</b>. Once aperture is constrained, you are in <b>eyepiece mode</b>. Well-equipped amateurs who have a number of eyepieces should also consider equipping themselves with a range of apertures.

				<p>Note that <b>wider angle eyepieces</b> allow for greater aperture.

				<p>One thing's for certain: I've bought and sold many eyepieces!<br>

			<button class='accordion' id='btnStoppingDownMatchingApertureWithEyeResolution'>Stopping down to match aperture resolution with eyepiece resolution</button>
			<div class='panel'>
				<p>An interesting problem is to ask what aperture matches the resolution of an eyepiece. For example, with a F5 telescope, a 20mm eyepiece gives a pupil of 4mm (20mm/5). We know that the eye's best resolution calls for a pupil of about 1mm, though with some straining, it is possible to see all the detail with a pupil of 2mm. In our example then the 4mm pupil is wasting most of the aperture's resolving power (neglecting atmospheric effects). The aperture could be shrunk by 4x which shrinks the pupil from 4mm to 1mm to match the eyepiece's resolution capability. This comes with the cost of a major reduction in star brightness and deep sky contrast for objects of large apparent size. Put another way, the aperture's potential resolution is best realized when the pupil is 1mm (up to 2mm), or when the eyepiece's focal length is equal to the focal ratio.

		<div class='designer' id='designComaCorrector'>
			<p>The TeleVue P2 2 inch coma corrector requires an additional 3/4 inch inward travel and moves the focal plane outward 1 13/16 inches.

			<p>I place the primary mirror focal plane 1 15/64 inches above focuser block top and since the focuser's compression ring is 3/8 inch thick, the primary mirror focal plane is positioned 55/64 inch above focuser's compression ring top. This results in the primary mirror focal plane being positioned 35/64 inch above coma corrector barrel bottom.

			<p>I use 5/16 inch in-travel for observers who are strongly near sighted.

			<p>Optically the coma corrector needs to be positioned at the designed distance from the primary mirror and its focal plane. However, for very fast telescopes F3.0 and faster where the eyepieces' spherical aberration affects image quality, the coma corrector can be re-positioned to minimize spherical aberration while not materially affecting the coma correction. A mirror that is cooling in the evening that exhibits overcorrection (or undercorrection as in the case of meniscus mirrors) can be brought back to proper correction by slightly altering the position of the coma corrector. Small changes in the coma corrector's position significantly alters the spherical aberration while hardly affecting the cancellation of coma. Using the star test I estimate 1/8 wavefront change for each one letter change of the P2's tunable top.

			<p>This calls for a new concept in focusing where two focusers are needed: one of limited range to adjust the position of the coma corrector and the other to adjust the position of the eyepiece. With the P2 I focus in three stages. First, I use the focuser to roughly position the P2, secondly I use the P2's tunable top to optimize the eyepiece position, then finally I return to the focuser to bracket the focus a couple of times until I can precisely find the center of focus.

			<h4>Interpreting diagonal sizes</h4>

			<p>For the complete picture, the chart includes light lost from the diagonal obstruction. Larger diagonals improve off-axis illumination but cost light across the entire field.

			<p>Use the magnitude scale; avoid percentages of illumination: the eye responds logarithmically, not linearly. It's a mistake to be upset over a 5% light loss when in fact from the eye's perspective the light loss is an imperceptible 1/20 magnitude.

			<p>Coma correctors like barlow lenses are best thought of as eyepiece accessories. Just reduce the desired field size by the coma corrector or barlow's magnification factor. Ignore the change in the focal plane. For example, if the coma corrector magnifies 15% then reduce the desired field to illuminate by 15%. Vignetting is not an issue down to F2.6 for pupils 7mm and smaller.

			<p>I find light loss of less than 0.3 magnitude hardly noticeable. For extended objects where both the background and object drop equally in magnitude, the contrast or ratio is unchanged, meaning that the eye's ability to detect the object remains largely unchanged. For instance, compare a 10 inch to a 12 inch telescope - the magnitude drop is 0.4. I can detect this difference when comparing views on borderline objects.  A drop of 0.5 magnitude or more is not readily detectable on brighter objects. However, the difference between a 10 inch and a 11 inch telescope is much smaller at 0.2 magnitudes and not readily apparent.

			<p>An object's detectability depends on contrast between object and sky, apparent size of the object and the object's brightness. The contrast is the ratio between the object's brightness per area (typically one arc-second squared) added to the sky background brightness that is in front of the object and the sky background brightness adjacent to the object (contrast=(object+sky) / sky). When a star or extended object is dimmed as it approaches the edge of the field of view, so is the sky background. Contrast remains the same. Experiments that I have conducted show that the object's detectability is not diminished as much as the raw magnitude loss suggests. Besides, if critical detection is required, then the object can be brought to the center of the field.

			<p>Diagonals act to degrade optical performance, the larger the diagonal, the worse the degradation. A one-third obstruction, a much larger ratio than the customary visual Newtonian uses, degrades the optical quality by about 1/14 wave RMS. Changes less than one-eight wave are very difficult to see. However, a smaller diagonal does not always result in improved views.

			<p>In particular I recommend analysis on the effects of central obstruction and optical quality like Damien Peach's at <a href='http://www.damianpeach.com/simulation.htm' target='_blank'>http://www.damianpeach.com/simulation.htm</a>.

			<div id='secondarySizeExperiment'></div>
			<button class='accordion' id='btnSecondarySizeExperiment'>The 1974 Telescope Secondary Experiment</button>
			<div class='panel'>
				<p>I wanted the most from my new 14.25 inch [36cm] Horseshoe mounted reflector.&nbsp; Conventional wisdom of the era was that a reasonably sized secondary of 1/5 to 1/4 the diameter of the primary mirror was fine, that there was little benefit to going to a smaller secondary. Some people though were agitating that secondary size mattered a great	deal, that I would only be getting the very best images if my secondary	was small. Maybe there were onto something, maybe convention wisdom was	wrong.<br>

				<img alt='' loading='lazy' src='14 inch in alleyway.JPG'>

				<p>Worried that I might not achieve the very best images, I designed a nifty self-collimating quick-mount secondary holder so that I could swap back and forth between two diagonals: the smallest possible diagonal for planetary and lunar imaging and a larger diagonal for deep-sky use. What resulted was a surprise.

				<p>Here is the 1.83 inch diagonal in its self-collimating quick-mount holder. The large diagonal was a 2.60 inch. I built a motorized slide focuser with a single straight stalk diagonal holder. The 1.83 inch
				diagonal was 1/8 the diameter of the 14.25 inch primary and the 2.60 diagonal was 1/5 the diameter of the primary.<br>

				<img alt='' loading='lazy' src='14 inch diagonal with self collimating quick change adapter.jpg'>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' src='14 inch single stalk diagonal holder.jpg'>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' src='14 inch focusing plate.jpg'>

				<p>In the 1970's, besides doing a great deal of visual observing, I was into eyepiece projection photography of the planets and cold-camera long exposure astrophotography.

				<p>I compared the two diagonals visually over many nights observing the planets with colored filters. I compared hundreds of highly magnified eyepiece projection negatives and slides. For deep-sky I visually counted stars in a small region of M13, the great Hercules Globular Cluster.

				<p>After a number of months I was forced to conclude that visually there was no noticeable difference on planetary images and no difference in star counts on M13. To my utter surprise, after months of photographing Jupiter and Saturn, I was forced to concede a very slight advantage to the 2.60 inch diagonal, the opposite of my expectation. How could this be?

				<p>Could the 2.60 inch diagonal be covering a bad center zone of the primary mirror? No, the mirror is without zones.

				<p>Could there be alignment or vignetting issues? No, I checked again and again.

				<p>Could there be a difference in optical quality of the diagonals? Perhaps the 1.83 diagonal had a slight edge problem. After all, only when a diagonal is absolutely minimally sized will its edge be used to form the image at the center of the field of view. I was forced to conclude that this was the most likely reason.

				<p>The real message though is that closely sized diagonals do not make a discernable difference in visual performance. Intrigued I set about making larger masks of 1/4, 1/3 and 1/2 the size of the primary. Over several nights I saw a consistent result: the 1/4 mask give nearly almost identical performance to the existing diagonals, but the 1/3 mask caused a modest degradation and the 1/2 sized mask gave sad images. I also realized that the best mask for star testing spherical  aberration or overall correction of a telescope is a 1/3 mask. Well, how about them apples, as my father used to say.

				<p>I learned to avoid worrying about secondary size, and became aware of Parkinson's Law of Triviality. I also learned to ignore fear and concentrate on getting the most from all the factors involved.

			<div id='diagonalOffsetStudy'></div>
			<button class='accordion' id='btnDiagonalOffsetStudy'>Diagonal offset study</button>
			<div class='panel'>
				<p>A Newtonian telescope's diagonal must be offset in order to center the cone of illumination on the field of view. Because of geometry, there it is not possible to center the cone of illumination on the center of the field of view while also satisfying the desire for even illumination at the edge of the field. The diagonal is offset in relation to the focuser, so either the diagonal can be moved or the focuser can be moved. I assume a fixed focuser. Let's see why an offset is desired.

				<p>First, we'll pick a 12 inch [30cm] F4 telescope and select a 2.6 inch [6.6cm] minor axis diagonal with a diagonal to focal plane distance of 10 inches.<br>

				<img alt='' loading='lazy' src='DiagonalOffsetStudy/diagonal not offset.jpg'>

				<p>...and in detail...<br>

				<img alt='' loading='lazy' src='DiagonalOffsetStudy/diagonal not offset detail.jpg'>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' src='DiagonalOffsetStudy/projection of field and diagonal no offset.jpg'>

				<p>Oops, centering the diagonal on the primary mirror's axis results in the diagonal not being centered under the focal point. Projection causes the near edge of the diagonal to appear bigger because it is closer and the far edge of the diagonal to appear smaller because it is further away. The diagonal does not evenly intercept the light rays converging from the primary mirror.

				<p>Re-aligning the primary mirror slightly upward so that the converging light cone is aimed squarely at the diagonal does not work because the reflected converging beam will not be centered under the focuser, because the re-aimed mirror's axis is no longer coincident with the mechanical axis resulting in pointing errors and because the tilted incoming beam of light is vignetted by the upper end.

				<p>Our only recourse is to slide the diagonal towards the primary mirror and away from the focuser like this.<br>

				<p>Now the diagonal intercepts the entire light cone converging to the focal point. But what about the field of view, particularly the edges of the field? Here's the layout for a 1.5 inch [3.8cm] wide field.<br>

				<img alt='' loading='lazy' src='DiagonalOffsetStudy/diagonal with field not offset detail.jpg'>

				<p>Let's add in the light cones from the left side and right side of the field. Note that just like the light cone converging to the focal point, the light cones have an angle of 14.4 degrees.<br>

				<img alt='' loading='lazy' src='DiagonalOffsetStudy/field light cones detail.jpg'>

				<p>Now let's place the diagonal, offset to illuminate the focal point properly as above.<br>

				<img alt='' loading='lazy' src='DiagonalOffsetStudy/diagonal offset with unevenly illuminated field light cones detail.jpg'>

				<p>First, we see that both light cones are vignetted by the diagonal size, leaving us with illumination falloff at the edges of the field of roughly 0.4 magnitude. Secondly, we see that the right edge of the field receives more light than the left edge of the field as the left edge has a 10.6 degree cone of illumination and the right edge has a 11.6 degree cone of illumination.<br>

				<img alt='' loading='lazy' src='DiagonalOffsetStudy/projection of field and diagonal center offset.jpg'>

				<p>By reducing the offset by a third, the diagonal can be repositioned to balance the edge illumination reaching the left and right edges of the field, but then the primary mirror's entire converging cone of light will be slightly off-center to the left.<br>

				<img alt='' loading='lazy' src='DiagonalOffsetStudy/projection of field and diagonal edge offset.jpg'>

			<div class='panel'>
				<p>	Every aspect of telescope design is a compromise that can be optimized. For example, consider aperture. More aperture means deeper (and narrower angle) viewing but at the cost of size, weight and price. Is a larger aperture scope used occasionally in dark skies a better value than a smaller scope set up in the yard? Perhaps the answer is both but then budget takes a hit.

				<p>Two unheard of optimizations that I make are a narrower upper end and intrusion into the light path of the coma corrector. What do I gain by doing so?

				<h4>Optimize for size and weight: a narrower upper end</h4>

				<p>A narrower upper end means less weight, a smaller spider, perhaps a smaller diagonal and potentially a correspondingly smaller mirror box. In a fast focal ratio telescope, the diagonal is typically sized to deliver adequate (not 100%, but 70% or so) illumination at the edge of the lowest power eyepiece. Looking from the extreme off-axis point, we see that the portion of the primary mirror that is vignetted by a narrower upper end is very small, in the neighborhood of several percent or a few hundredths of a magnitude. It is worth it to give up a few hundredths of magnitude illumination at the extreme edge in order to go down in diagonal size.<br>

				<p><img alt='' loading='lazy' src='SmallerUpperCage\schematic.jpg'>

				<h4>Optimize for light throughput: a smaller diagonal with intruding coma corrector</h4>

				<p>Optimizing diagonal size is all about selecting for the smallest responsible diagonal. Moving the focuser closer in to the diagonal means a smaller diagonal. For fast focal ratio scopes, the minimum diagonal size is calculated by dividing the diagonal to image plane distance by the focal ratio. For example, if the diagonal to image plane distance is 12 inches and the focal ratio is f4, then the minimum sized diagonal is 12/4 = 3 inches. For very fast scopes, f3.5, f3.0, f2.5, the coma corrector can jut into the light path. So the focuser is moved outward, resulting in a larger diagonal. But let's think about what we are truly optimizing, namely, obstruction. Obstruction reduces the light going to the image plane and produces diffraction. More obstruction, more diffraction (the shape of the obstruction determines the shape of the diffraction). The total obstruction of a minimally sized diagonal and the coma corrector slightly jutting into the light path can be less than a larger diagonal by itself. This is a worthy optimization to make, minimizing light loss and diffraction.<br>

				<p><img alt='' loading='lazy' src='small diagonal with coma corrector intrusion.jpg'>

				<p>A narrower upper end and allowing some intrustion of a coma corrector into the light path are two optimizations to consider.

			<div id='offAxisMask'></div>
			<button class='accordion' id='btnOffAxisMask'>Thoughts on an off-axis mask</button>
			<div class='panel'>
				<p>Stopping down by using an off-axis mask is a time honored way to beat seeing and to cut the dazzling light of the Moon and bright planets in large aperture scopes.

				<p>Stopping down is less popular today. This could be so because of drifting preferences. It is also a testament to learning how to use large Dobsonian mirrors in the dropping night time air by cooling them with fans.

				<p>The maximum diameter of an off-axis mask is set by taking the primary mirror's diameter and subtracting the diagonal's minor axis size then dividing the result by two. For example, a 16 inch with a 3.5 inch diagonal has a maximum off-axis mask diameter of (16 - 3.5) / 2 = 6.25 inches. If placed opposite any diagonal offset, the off-axis mask's diameter can be increased by the offset.

				<p>The light throughput is the inverse of the mask diameter to primary mirror diameter squared. Using the numbers from above, (off-axis mask diameter / primary mirror diameter) squared is (6.25 / 16) ^2 = 0.15 or 15% light throughput. That dims the Moon's brightness by two magnitudes.

				<p>When using an off-axis mask at lower powers, be sure to account for vignetting due to smaller sized diagonals that act to clip the off-axis aperture.

				<p>Make a black cardboard mask with a one inch off-axis hole and aim at a bright star. The Airy disk and many rings look textbook beautiful. But that costs resolution. Of course this resolution is wasted at low magnification.

				<p>What is the relationship between the off-axis mask's resolution and the telescope's magnification? What size should the off-axis mask be to resolve all that is possible at a particular magnification?

				<p>Since the eye's entrance pupil at best resolution is 1mm in size, the eyepiece's exit pupil is the factor that the primary mirror's aperture can be reduced. For example, an exit pupil of 6mm (the exit pupil is calculated by taking the eyepiece's focal length in mm and dividing by the primary mirror's focal ratio) means that the off-axis mask should be 1/6 the diameter of the primary, an exit pupil of 3mm means that the off-axis mask should be 1/3 the diameter of the primary. This leads to the conclusion that the smallest exit pupil to use with the maximally sized off-axis mask is 2-3mm.

				<p>There is also a very simple and easy to remember relationship between aperture and magnification with respect to resolution. And it is this: the telescope will resolve all that the human eye can see when the aperture in inches equals the magnification divided by 25. For example, at 100x, the off-axis mask should be at least 4 inches in diameter, 100 / 25 = 4.

				<p>For the 16 incher's off-axis mask mentioned above, the optimal magnification is 6.25 * 25 = 156x.

				<p>That's it! Now you can make those off-axis masks understanding the brightness reduction and the best fitting magnification (or what diameter to make the off-axis mask given a desired magnification).

				<p>Note: double star observing with smaller apertures can double, even quadruple the optimum magnification, up to the seeing limit of the sky, in order to better see the Airy disk and rings.

				<p>A final note: large off-axis masks on fast scopes require a coma corrector just as the full aperture view. Otherwise the star image is badly distorted by astigmatism. Selecting a different quadrant for the mask makes a difference. Tilting the eyepiece by about 5 degrees may help.

			<p>Babinet's principle states that diffracted light is proportional to the area obstructed, not the edges. And the length of the diffraction spike is inversely proportional to the spider vanes thickness. For example, if the spider vanes can be made half as thick then the total diffracted light is cut by half and the length of the spikes is increased, causing a further reduction in the brightness of the diffraction spikes.

			<p>Today I use wire spiders because they are very thin. In fact, I only see small spikes in large apertures on the brightest stars. I find the refractor like views aesthetically satisfying. Wire spiders were popularized by Henry E. Paul in his "Telescopes for Skygazing", 1965. Today there is an explosion of creativity thanks to Larry Shaper, Mark Cowan, Jerry Oltion and others. The strength of the wires is dependent on gemetry and  independent of tension; consequently, I tighten the wires only to the point of avoiding sagging.

			<p>If using a hub to hold the diagonal, orient the hub vertically. I measure a 3x reduction in laser collimator dot travel on the primary mirror compared to orienting the hub horizontally. Tom Otvos and Mark Cowan pointed this out to me. Luckily I oriented the 25" hub vertically; my previous scopes had the hub horizontally.

			<p>You can see that I've also used single stalk spiders and 'V' spiders as appropriate. The diffraction pattern of a single stalk spider is not too ugly, considering the thickness of the stalk. There is room for invention here, combining a thinner single stalk with a couple of tensioned very thin wires. The diffraction pattern for a single stalk spider extends from the star like outstretched hands as a short thick tapered line of light turned 90 degrees to the stalk. Extending the stalk through to the opposite side of the tube increases diffraction.

			<p>The 'V' spider produces two spikes, each at 90 degrees to a vane, each with less intensity than the single stalk spider.

			<p>Future exploration includes thinner single stalk vane in combination with thin wires.

			<h4>Designing wire spiders</h4>

			<p>It is important to wrap your arms around the fact that wire spiders gain their strength from geometry, not from tensioning. Increasing the tension on the wires does not make the wire spider stronger. The wires are tightened only to the point of not sagging.

			<p>Every diagonal needs two support considerations:
			<ul>
				<li>Static: keep a consistent position so that optical alignment and focus do not change.
				<li>Dynamic: resist vibration caused by wind or bumps to the telescope. This manifests itself as a high magnification elongation to the stars with large heavy diagonals that disappears when the diagonal holder is touched.
			</ul>

			<p>Therefore wires need two geometries:
			<ul>
				<li>Cross wires such so that the tension force on the wires is reduced by taking advantage of geometry.
				<li>Arrange wires so that they do not cross in the center to reduce rotational quivering by heavier diagonals.
			</ul>
			<img alt='' loading='lazy' src='wire spider illustrated.jpg'>

			<p>Since the diagonal is cantilevered, the spider can deform, misplacing the diagonal. One approach from decades ago is to add a small counterweight on a longer arm opposite the diagonal. This carries with it the downside that the diagonal can vibrate at a low frequency if energy is dumped into it.

			<p>Jonathan Pogson finds an issue with wire spiders in that flexure in the upper ring affects offset designs (here, offset means how the vanes attach to the upper ring) exposing an issue in the common use of crossed wires. He also finds that the stiffest design remains an offset solid vane spider mounted on an infinitely stiff upper ring. However a very wide hub with vanes on axis is almost as good, and has the benefit of eliminating exposure to flexure in the upper ring.

			<h4>Discussion</h4>

			<p>The cell designs presented here should be considered a starting point. I like to think of the mirror cell and the mirror working in concert to deliver a quality wavefront to the focal plane. In fact I do final figuring with the mirror in its cell.

			<p>A telescope mirror sags between support points due to gravity bending and shearing. There are three approaches to calculating the necessary number of support points so that the bending and shearing of glass is insignificant at the focal plane. They are: 1) Hubble's equal area rule, 2) structural deformation calculations, and 3) finite element analysis. To a useful approximation, all three agree.

			<p>For 3 point support, minimum bending before refocusing occurs at the 70% radius while after refocusing minimum bending occurs at the 40% radius. See <a href='https://www.davidlewistoronto.com/plop/' target='_blank'>David Lewis' discussion and further references to Luc Arnold and Richard Schwartz</a>. Texereau placed the support points just inside the edge to better position the mirror with respect to the edge supports. We can conclude that the radius can range from 40% to near 100% with but a slight degradation in the cell's ability to support the mirror.<br>
			For 6 point supports, the ring that the 6 points form is best placed at a radius of 57% according to PLOP. Six point designs are nearly as good as 9 points and have been popular from at least the 1960's. The support radius can vary from 50% to 71% without too much degradation. It is interesting that by turning a 3 point ring into 6 points, the optimal radius moves outward closer to an equal area inside and outside of the ring.<br>
			For 9 point supports, place the inner ring at the 33% radius and the outer ring at the 72% radius. If x is outer radius and y is inner radius then balance point = 2/3(cos(30)x-y) + y) = 2/3*cos(30)x + y/3 = 0.577x + y/3 = 52.6%<br>
			For 18 point supports, place the radii at 38% and 76%. If x is outer radius and y is inner radius then balance point = 2/3(cos(15)x-y) + y) = 2/3*cos(15)x + y/3 = 0.644x + y/3 = 61.6%. Using similar math as the 9 point support design, place the bar centers at the 53.4% radius.

			<p>To further lessen the mirror's bending over individual support points, small triangles or circles of material sanded to fit the mirror's backside can be fitted to each support point. This can cut deformation that appears in the star test as coarse surface roughness.

			<p>Most important is the quality of construction and the balance of the pieces.

			<p>Edge supports are analyzed in R.N.Wilson's Reflecting Telescope Optics, Volume II. A simple edge support with points at exactly 90 degrees separation cancels primary astigmatism, fairing quite well. Each support point can be replaced with a 2-point whiffle tree in order to spread the load, lessening local deformation next to each support point. Slings are even better, though tough to build without side effects, whilst the best support is a ring of astatic levers where the lower levers support the mirror from bottom up and the upper levers pull up on the mirror's upper edge. Edge supports should be compliant so that they do not hold up the mirror as it settles into the cell as the telescope points upward.

			<p>Typically the mirror's defects dominate the mirror cell, meaning that the mirror cell adds very little error to the optical system. For example, consider a mirror of 1/6 wavefront peak-valley error that is otherwise smooth. The 1/6 peak-valley wavefront is about 90 nm peak-valley wavefront error in green light. That is 45 nm peak-valley on the mirror's surface. Even a crude mirror cell of say 35 nm peak-valley error (10 nm RMS) does not materially degrade the optical performance. Errors are added by root mean square, so a mirror of 45 nm peak-valley added to a mirror cell error of 35 nm peak-valley results in a total error of nearly 57 nm peak-valley or 1/4.6 wavefront. This is a degradation of only 1/20 wavefront from the mirror's 1/6 wavefront!

			<h4>Discussion</h4>

			<p>We want the 'good' light to reach our eye, the 'rogue' light to be blocked. Some rogue light we simply cannot block because it comes from the upper atmosphere exactly between the object and our telescope. This includes sky glow and reflected light pollution. Other rogue light strays into our eyes. This we can block with a hood over our head or by cupping the eyepiece with our hands. Remaining rogue light can sneak past the diagonal into the eyepiece and sneak past from behind the primary mirror, bouncing off the diagonal to fog the eyepiece.

			<p>The rogue light sneaking past the diagonal can be blocked with a baffle. This baffle is called the projected focuser baffle or diagonal baffle. And rogue light sneaking past from behind the primary mirror can be blocked by baffles that surround the primary mirror. This baffle is called the primary mirror baffle. The baffle designer calculates the minimum size for these baffles based on geometric light ray traces. An additional baffle, not shown and not calculated, can be placed just below the focuser to tighten up the projected focuser or diagonal baffle.

			<p>Using an idea by Larry Shaper in Amateur Astronomy magazine, Issue #91, Summer 2016, page 52-53, the edges of the baffle can be tilted to direct light away from the focuser's tube bottom aperture. Larry concludes that the flattest black paint always looks gray while a baffle painted in gloss black with tilted sides looks truly black. You can see that the tilt angles light past the focuser tube and is long enough that light reflected at a narrow angle face on is also directed away from the focuser tube. Since the optical tube assembly can be open, I tilt the projected focuser baffle on both sides.

			<p>Design the baffle by starting with projecting the light from the focal plane to the bottom of the focuser's tube. This cone of light needs to be blocked to prevent fogging of the focal plane. This is colored lime green. Next, set the angle of the baffle by dividing the angle between the lines: the vertical line across the tube opening and the line from the tube front bottom to the inside bottom edge of the focuser tube. This is colored light green. Finally, determine the edge of the angled baffle segment by finding the point where light is blocked from the bottom of the focuser tube. This is colored dark green.

			<h4>Lowrider discussion</h4>

			<p>By increasing the diagonal's angle, we can aim move the focuser a little closer to the primary mirror, lessening the eyepiece's height above the ground.

			<p>Why a folded reflector (popular name, 'low rider')? It's all about convenience: the eyepiece height above ground is shortened. This can make the difference between ladder and no ladder or between high up a ladder and stepping up onto a stool.

			<p>An early example of a folded (or low rider) reflector is Ed Danilovicz's 12 inch, featured in Sky and Telescope magazine, April 1976 pg 278.

			<h4>Binoscope discussion</h4>

			<p>The gray shape represents an adult human's face, neck and shoulders.
			<p>The secondary is calculated for minimum size to illuminate the center of the field of view. The tertiary is calculated for full illumination of the field, which is likely excessive.
			<p>Excess focal plane to secondary distance is used to bend the secondary to tertiary light angle. When the secondary bending angle is locked at a particular angle then the focal plane to secondary distance is reset to what is needed to accommodate the locked bending angle.
			<p>A bent tertiary (adding eyepiece divergence) can reduce secondary to tertiary distance, permit a smaller secondary and reduce central obstruction. The eyepieces are consequently tilted toward each other and slid off-center. Here are images of a proposed 30 inch F2.7 bent design. You can inspect this design by switching to the Export/Import designer then selecting the proposed 30 inch design.<br>

			<h4>Visual observations</h4>

			<p>With the caveat that results vary from observer to observer and from binoscope to binoscope, I find that stars are enhanced by about 20% and extended nebulae by up to 80% with an average enhancement of about 40%. An enhancement of 40% means that a binoscope using twin 10 inch [25cm] mirrors is roughly equivalent to a 14 inch [36cm] aperture telescope. This enhancement, called the binocular summation factor, is thought to be a combination of probability summation, an increase in the signal to noise ratio, or neural summation. Curiously, melding the two 10 inch [25cm] apertures together equal a 14 inch [36cm] mirror. For more, see <a href='https://arieotte-binoscopes.nl/Binocular%20Summation%20Factor.pdf' target='_blank'>https://arieotte-binoscopes.nl/Binocular%20Summation%20Factor.pdf</a>

			<p>Notwithstanding the binocular summation, I find the greatest advantage of a binoscope to be a milky smooth perspective to extended objects. Returning to monocular viewing (as simple as closing one eye), I see extensive and bothersome mottling and scintillation that gradually recedes over an hour or two.

			<div id='vibration'></div>
			<button class='accordion' id='btnVibration'>Telescope vibration</button>
			<div class='panel'>
				<p>Vibration is a particular concern to telescope users.  Not only are telescopes prone to vibration thanks to heavy weights at one or both ends, but whatever vibrations are present are highly magnified when looking through the eyepiece.  That's why telescopes have massive mountings - to combat vibration.  In the old days (1960's), the most popular type of amateur telescope was a 6 inch newtonian on a pipe mount.  The rule of thumb was to focus, then stand back and count to twelve to let the vibrations quiet down.  Nowadays amateur telescopes are typically mounted on a Dobsonian mount - a form of an altazimuth mount much like a battleship's guns.  An excellently designed and built Dobsonian telescope will quiet down in one second or less.

				<p>There are three sources of vibration: wind, hand touching, and motor drives.  As the wind buffets a telescope, the scope's cross section, substantial thanks to its length, absorbs a surprising amount of energy, moving the telescope tube about its center of gravity imperceptibly.  When the wind calms or momentarily swirls, the tube will spring back, setting up a vibration.  Similarly when hand touching a telescope to focus an eyepiece or to make a positional adjustment, the telescope will spring back when the hand is let go.

				<p>Telescope users care about three principal characteristics of telescope vibration: the amplitude, the frequency, and the dampening time.  The amplitude is the amount of back and forth movement.  This can be measured at the eyepiece in arc-minutes or arc-seconds where the planet Jupiter is on average 45 arcseconds of size.  The frequency is the number of vibrations per second.  Most telescopes vibrate at a low enough rate to be estimated by counting the shakes over a second or two.  The dampening time is the amount of time in seconds that it takes for the vibration to come to a halt.   An ideal telescope will have small amplitude and short dampening time.  For instance, a Dobsonian telescope might have an amplitude of 1 arcminute, a frequency of 5 Hertz, and a dampening time of 1 second.

				<p>Wooden and aluminum truss Dobsonian telescopes typically have a frequency of several Hertz, that is, they vibrate back and forth several times a second.   The relatively slow speed is due to large masses at some distance from the center of gravity.  The frequency can be increased by making the upper end lighter, by making the mirror box lighter, and by shorting the tube.   Increasing the frequency is desirable as the overall dampening time will often shorten.

				<p>Vibration is absorbed by the ground and by the mount itself.  A slightly soft surface such as grass or dirt will absorb vibration much better than concrete.  But if the ground is too soft then it may act to amplify slow telescope vibrations.  To promote absorption, sorbathane pads should be placed between the mount's feet and the ground.    These pads absorb vibrations, prevent vibrations from traveling back into the telescope, and give the mount a slower characteristic resonant frequency.   Wooden and aluminum mounts are somewhat flexible and therefore have more vibration absorbing ability.  The frequency is lower with these mounts.   In addition, these mounts suppress harmonics.  The sorbathane pads respond slowly to vibration and therefore lower the natural frequency of the mount.   Dangling chains from the upper end of the tube absorb vibration as they clang together.  Another more common tactic is to place vibration absorbing material such as sorbathane-, rubber, and leather between critical components of the mount.

				<p>While the hand can be a source of vibration moving and focusing the telescope, the hand can also be used to absorb vibration by touching the upper end while viewing.

				<p>Vibration caused by wind can be significantly reduced by removing as much as possible of the telescope tube's cross section.  Instead of the completely encircled upper cage and shroud, amateur telescope makers have used single ring upper ends drilled with holes without shrouds to good effect in windy conditions.

				<p>This will expose the diagonal to the wind, consequently an ordinary spider may no longer suffice.   In windy conditions, the heavy diagonal causes the diagonal holder to very rapidly vibrate about the spider center in a back and forth rotational arc.  Splitting the spider so that the four vanes come to two points forming what looks like two 'V's that are not quite touching, removes the ability of the diagonal to rotate about the diagonal axis.

				<p>Finally, the motor tracking system can induce vibration.  Any change from a completely smooth motor movement can induce vibration.  This can come from the motor, from the motor coupling, and from the gearing.  Very rarely if at all does the gearing cause vibration.  But if a repeating or periodic error in the gearing is bumping or throwing the scope, and if the frequency of this error coincides with the natural resonant frequency of the mount, vibration not only would be induced but also amplified.

				<p>A coupler between the motor and the gearing is designed ease misalignment of the shafts and possibly absorb motor vibration.  However even with a flexible coupler, badly misaligned shafts can cause vibration as they spin.  The coupler itself can induce vibration also.  If it is flexible, it might tighten and relax on its own accord, causing a sporadic jitter at the eyepiece.  This can occur when the friction to rotate the output shaft is significant compared to the force required to twist the coupler.  Here the coupler will tighten until finally it can transmit enough torque, at which point the shaft will skip ahead and the coupler will relax and shaft movement will cease until the coupler is would up again.  The coupler can also indirectly cause vibration if the motor control feedback is on the opposite end of the coupler from the motor.  The feedback algorithm will have a varying delay caused by the twist up of the coupler introduced, causing it to feed large control signals to the motor first one way, then the other way.  These control signals can cause the motor to transmit large oscillatory movements through the coupler into the telescope mount.

				<p>Typically in servo motor systems, the overall gearing reduction is less, putting a premium on the coupler.  So couplers for servo systems should be rigid, particularly if geared lightly and if the motor control feedback is on the other side of the coupler.  The coupler can be somewhat flexible in highly geared servo systems and in stepper motor systems.  The coupler should be as short as possible otherwise the windup effects mimic a long spring.

				<p>With modern servo systems, the control system can induce very slight vibrations.  The pulse width modulation often used to control the motor velocity might be felt.  The control system algorithm may have periodicies and the feedback loop may  induce vibration under certain load conditions.

				<p>With stepper systems and their typically highly geared drivetrain, a somewhat flexible coupler can help smooth out any jerkiness in the stepper motor as it moves from step to step.  Stepper motors snap from step to step when operating in fullstep or halfstep mode.  This causes a jittery motion in the eyepiece that can be quite objectionable.   A good test for this is to turn the drive off and on to see if there is any difference in the image quality.  Another way to test is to put fingers lightly on the eyepiece.  Jittery and higher speed oscillations can often be felt, if not downright heard by the ear.

				<p>Metal tubed telescopes such as refractors don't have the natural frequency absorbing characteristics of wood and aluminum Dobsonian mounts.  Metal tubed telescopes also tend to not only vibrate at the lower frequencies caused by the entire tube shaking, but also tend to vibrate at higher frequencies and at harmonics of lower frequencies.  This is manifested in the eyepiece as a very high speed wobble, perhaps only detectable by a frame to frame analysis by a camcorder, by the drive off and on test, or possibly by the finger test.   Ideas to try to cure high speed vibrations include placing a piece of dampening material between tube and cradle, significantly beefing up the mount, and not allowing potential sources of vibration to occur.  These include stomping around the scope, wind, pulling and shaking of cables, and nearby car and rail traffic.

			<div class='panel'>
				<p>The ballscope is a wonderful mount; it commands a loyal following. With a single push the scope can move in both axes and rotate the eyepiece to a comfortable viewing angle. And there is no overhead 'Dobson' hole at the zenith, the bane of altazimuth scopes.

				<p>Ballscopes can track. Norm James (San Diego, California) in the late 1960's devised a motorized polar axis attached by suction cup on his 'spheremount'. 
				See <a href= 'http://www.cloudynights.com/ubbthreads/attachments/3729721-JAMES%2C NORM - spheremount - 1A.jpg' target='_blank'> http://www.cloudynights.com/ubbthreads/attachments/3729721-JAMES%2C NORM - spheremount - 1A.jpg</a>.

				<p>Circa 1990 Alphonse Pouplier (Belgium) invented a two drive wheel and two motor 'crossed parallel' mounting that tracked, slewed to an object and tracked satellites (August 1993, Sky and Telescope magazine).<br> Pierre LeMay (Quebec) in the mid-1990's devised a polar oriented two roller drive system. Pierre's 20 inch f3.9 scope is pictured here 
				<a href= 'http://stellafane.org/convention/2013/images/scopes/scope14a.jpg' target='_blank'>http://stellafane.org/convention/2013/images/scopes/scope14a.jpg</a>.

				<p>About 2010 Jerry Oltion independently invented a single motorized polar axis drive system that he calls the TrackBall. 
				See <a href= 'http://www.sff.net/people/j.oltion/trackball.htm' target='_blank'>http://www.sff.net/people/j.oltion/trackball.htm</a>

				<p>The size and weight of the ball becomes prohibitive in scopes larger than 20 inches [0.5m] aperture.Here are my ideas to modify the ballscope for larger apertures. First, the standard ball scope: a ball for pointing with the attached upper telescope tube:<br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' src='ballscopes/ballscope.jpg'>

				<p>As you can see, the ball is about twice the aperture. For a 20 inch [0.5m] scope, the ball size would be approximately 40 inches [1m] but with careful thought as Pierre LeMay has demonstrated, it is possible to use a ball as small as 30 inch diameter. Otherwise such a telescope would be difficult to transport.

				<p>What would the ballscope look like if we start removing unused sections of the ball? If we give up pushing the scope all the way through the zenith to the far horizon and instead allow a modest movement through the zenith to cover 'Dobson's' hole, then the trimmed ballscope might look like:<br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' src='ballscopes/hemiballscope.jpg'><br>

				<p>Here's Frank Szczepanski's hemi-ballscope 8 inch f/5 which uses a half sphere from a barbecue lid and a plain old 5 gallon plastic bucket for a base.<br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' src='ballscopes/Frank Szczepanski hemiballscope.jpg'>

				<p>In this design the scope must be pushed around to reach the far horizon. However, large Dobs are often built with mirror mounts that use slings or two bottom edge supports at 90 degrees which preclude moving from horizon to far horizon by pushing through the zenith.

				<p>The ball is still too large but its weight has been cut in half. Let's keep going by acknowledging that in very large scopes, the eyepiece points out the side of the scope roughly horizontally within an angle of +- 20 degrees or so. Now the doubly trimmed ball scope might look like:<br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' src='ballscopes/side trimmed hemiballscope.jpg'>

				<p>The ball has been trimmed severely to a manageable size and weight. In fact, other than the extra effort to make the smooth spherical surface, it is about the same dimensions from side to side as a Dobsonian styled altazimuth mount. But unlike the Dob we can push through the zenith forbidden zone and rotate the focuser to a comfortable viewing angle.<p>Trimming the ball to a saucer shape and adding altitude bearings for motion
				up and down results in the following design:<br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' src='ballscopes/saucerscope.jpg'>

				<p>In this design the Dobsonian rocker box has been replaced with a curved saucer or Frisbee shape with an optional hole in the middle to allow the tube to swing through. The saucer acts to close Dobson's hole and allow the focuser to be adjusted to a comfortable angle. The altitude rims will need stops to keep the scope from sliding off. This has been demonstrated successfully by amateurs, e.g. <a href='../RobADob.html' target='_blank'>see Rob Adam's Rob-a-Dob</a>.

				<p>It is also possible to position the ball somewhat up the tube assembly. Then the telescope looks like:<br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' src='ballscopes/slipped ballscopes.jpg'><br>

				<p>Here's Frank Szczepanski's 4.25 inch slipped ballscope whose lower tube is from a round ice bucket and a sauce pan and chunk of lead that extends through the opening in the brown wooden box.<br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' src='ballscopes/Frank Szczepanski slipped ballscope.jpg'>

				<p>At the cost of a rocker box and the customary azimuth motion of a Dobsonian telescope, we can push through the zenith hole a few degrees and rotate the focuser to a good viewing angle at will. The rocker box contacts the ball at three points so the front panel needs reinforcing as shown and the side panels need trusses to not split apart (not shown).

				<p>These variations on the standard ballscope design show how the aperture limitation on ballscopes can be overcome.

				<p>Taking a completely different tack, the ballscope can be modified in an interesting and elegant fashion.

				<p>Let's start again with a side profile of the standard Dobsonian showing the telescope pointed horizontally and vertically:<br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' src='ballscopes/standard altitude rims.jpg'>

				<p>For large scopes with lighter primary mirrors, the altitude rims can be surprisingly large. It's possible to compress the altitude rims into a smaller elliptical shape, like a sleigh:<br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' src='ballscopes/elliptical bearings.jpg'>

				<p>Besides the obvious squeezing of the altitude bearings, something else very interesting happens: the tube assembly slides backwards as the telescope points down to the horizon. This means that elliptical bearings can handle telescopes when the center of gravity is located uncomfortably further up the telescope tube. Explained differently, the center of gravity slides vertically downward as the scope transitions from pointing at the zenith to pointing at the horizon. The consequence is that the altitude bearings can be made smaller. This is a design that I've successfully prototyped and discussed privately for several years now. The drawback is that the elliptical altitude bearings need a varying drive rate if the scope is to track and slew across the sky to point at an object.<p>If we marry the elliptical concept with the ballscope, then we get a new design, the 'Egg Scope':<br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' src='ballscopes/egg scope.jpg'>

				<p>This ovoid design is shaped in a complex elegant manner, inspired by Nature. Though difficult to track and slew, I find this design compelling. I wonder if it will ever be built.

			<button class='accordion' id='btnEarlOfCrawford'>The Earl of Crawford's tracking arm</button>
			<div class='panel'>
				<p>An equatorially mounted telescope has it easy. The telescope can track the stars with a simple slow constant rotation about the polar axis. This is called 'equatorial tracking'. An altazimuth mount rooted firmly on the ground is simpler and surer but cannot easily track - after all there's no polar axis. Instead tracking is a complicated affair of ever varying drive rates in both altitude and azimuth.

				<p>The Earl of Crawford devised a clever way so that an altazimuth telescope can simulate equatorial tracking. A cord is attached from a point on the polar axis to the end of the telescope's tube. The telescope tube is weighted in the rear to keep the cord tight. As the telescope swings across the sky constrained by the cord, it describes an equatorial tracking arc.

				<p>Here we see an altazimuth mounted telescope with the Earl of Crawford's tracking cord attached. The telescope is pointing at the celestial meridian (aimed southward, if in the northern hemisphere, aimed northward if in the southern hemisphere). The bottom of the tracking cord is attached to a point along the polar axis. Because the polar axis makes an angle of 45 degrees with respect to the horizon, the scope must be situated at a latitude of 45 degrees on Earth.<br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' src='EarlofCrawford\reflectorPointingSouthMeridian.jpg'>

				<p>Now let's swing the telescope across the sky, keeping the cord tight. The telescope will simulate an equatorial tracking arc across the sky.

				<p>Ideally, the cord is attached to a point on the telescope's optical axis since it is this optical axis that ought to track equatorially. Attaching to the side of the tube causes tracking errors. That's because the optical axis is not coincident to the axis defined by the arm's attachment point to the telescope tube and the intersection of the three axes: the polar axis, the azimuth axis and the altitude axis.

				<p>The arc that the Crawford arm swings through is not the same arc that the telescope's optical axis swings through. The 'Crawford' arc can be calculated by lowering the telescope's altitude reading by the angle the attachment point to the telescope's tube makes with the intersection of the three axes.

				<p>The following graphic shows the telescope equatorially tracking perfectly for two hours. The arc shows the slow movement of the telescope's optical axis across the sky. Check out how the optical axis is perfectly aligned with the end of the tracking arc.<br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' src='EarlofCrawford\reflectorAfterTwoHoursPerfectTracking.jpg'>
				 
				<p>Now let's check out where the telescope is pointed after two hours of simulated equatorial tracking motion by the Earl of Crawford arm. You can see an error in the tracking motion. In this case it is a substantial six degrees. That means that an object will drift out of the field of view in 10-20 minutes.<br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' src='EarlofCrawford\reflectorAfterTwoHoursCrawfordTracking.jpg'>

				<p>You can see this for yourself by performing this simple experiment. Attach a small telescope to the side of a Dobsonian telescope at some crazy angle, so that it is not pointed in the same direction as the Dobsonian. Point the Dobsonian on a bright star and note the field in the small auxiliary telescope. Wait a dozen minutes and re-aim the Dobsonian. Inspect the field of view through the eyepiece of the auxiliary telescope; you'll see that the field has drifted. That's the Crawford arm tracking error.

				<p>In the case of a telescope pointed at the celestial meridian, the change in altitude is minimal. If the Crawford's arm tracking speed is adjusted, the tracking error can be significantly reduced. In the image above, the Crawford arm can be moved further along, reducing the error to about a degree.

				<p>The Crawford arm was used on Lord Rosse's 72 inch Leviathan, perhaps taking advantage of the minimal altitude change.

				<p>This is why a Crawford arm for an equatorial table will only work when the arm is tied to the telescope's optical axis.

				<p>What to do? The essential problem is field rotation: the tube does not rotate to match the sky's twisting motion. If the tube cannot rotate, then perhaps the arm can.

				<p>If the arm is attached to a slippery rotating ring and pulled tight, then perfect tracking is restored.<br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' src='EarlofCrawford\CrawfordRing.jpg'>

				<p>Another answer is to elevate the tube such that a line parallel to the rod's attachment point to the telescope tube goes through the center of rotation of both the azimuth and altitude axes. The tube's off-center location will cause it to pull against the rod as it is swung upward.<br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' src='EarlofCrawford\reflectorOffsetTube.jpg'>

				<p>Yet another answer is to attach the arm to the optical axis that emerges from the back of the telescope tube. By adding a Declination clamp, we venture into the territory of the <a href='NewtDesigner.html#Morse' target='_blank'> Morse Transformer</a>, a wonderful analog equatorial to altazimuth calculator invented in the 1930's.

				<p>As I showed with the Morse Transformer, another possibility is to clone the telescope's altazimuth axes, moving them to the side of the telescope. Then a Crawford arm can be attached directly to the cloned optical axis that intersects the cloned polar axis. You can see that the tracking mechanism moves with the rocker box but the polar axis that intersects altitude axis and the cloned azimuth axis stays aligned with the sky.<br>

				<h3>Why 3 Axis Mounts?</h3>

				<p>I mean, geez, now you have three drives and three motors and they will have to be under computer control to boot. The attractiveness is that three axis mounts have no field rotation, and, can be aimed so that only a single axis need be moved to track satellites. In addition, three axis platforms free the builder from the constraint of building the latitude into the platform. Really, it's fun to investigate and design three axis mounts since the additional third axis opens up design possibilities, particularly if slewing is restricted to two axes and the third axis is of limited travel and only turned on to freeze field rotation during tracking. Time will tell whether the pluses will outweigh the additional complexity of three motors.

				<p>Here's some numbers showing three axis tracking with no field rotation for an alt-alt-az mount located at north 44 degrees latitude with the starting third axis azimith aimed below the pole, locked on object rising in the east. These are distances moved in each axis over one minute intervals. Specifically,<br>
				Altitude = 50 deg<br>
				Azimuth = 90 deg<br>
				Field rotation angle = 38.471

				<p>Tracking rates:<br>
				Rotation about sky's zenith = 0.173 deg<br>
				Primary altalt axis aimed at horiz = 0.254<br>
				Right angle to primary altalt axis = 0.164

				<p>The three motors are all moving at a rate with a magnitude of 1/7 to 1/4 degree per minute, which is analogous to the sidereal tracking rate, a very reasonable and easy rate of motion to achieve.

				<p>A 48 inch three axis scope has been located in Cloudcroft New Mexico for years. See <b>Manly's</b> Unusual Telescopes, page 88, and his discussion of three and four axis mounts on pages 84-91.

				<p>A computer controlled drive system is not a forgone conclusion. Decades ago before digital computers, some amateurs used a mechanism called an equatorial transformer that took mechanical action generated by a small equatorially aligned machine and forced the 2-3-4 axis mount into following its motion.

				<p><b>Richard Berry</b> has suggested a table mount with three motorized pistons. Also see my articles on turret equatorial tables and tilted equatorial tables.

				<h4>from Reflecting Telescopes by H. L. Smith from a column in Annals of Science, 1853</h4>

				<p>[Mel Bartels' introductory comments] The Holcombe mount stands as a remarkable achievement in design, anticipating modern design principles a century earlier. Holcombe's mount is simple, sturdy, with unexpectedly large aperture for its era. He eschewed tracking for the compelling task of visually revealing the heavens. There are remarkable similarities to John Dobson's design that came more than a century later. Holcombe also began this country's first telescope making company at a time when it was thought that Americans were not up to the task. When Alvan Clark began his ground breaking optics work, he visited Holcombe and purchased glass from him. Holcombe's mount lives on today in the guise of F.J.Seller's mount. America's oldest surviving observatory began with a Holcombe telescope, eventually to be replaced with a Clark refractor decades later, the task of re-polishing and figuring the speculum mirror proving too burdensome. A great image is at <a href='http://learninglab.si.edu/q/r/12225' target='_blank'>http://learninglab.si.edu/q/r/12225</a>

				<p>The stand for the reflecting telescope invented by Mr. Holcombe is undoubtedly the most economical and efficient ever made. Below is represented the general appearance of the telescope and stand.<br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' id='Graphic1' name='Graphic1' class='mediumSizeImage' src='holcombe-figure1.jpg'>

				<p>The lower end of the telescope, where the speculum is located at 'a', rests upon the ground; the upper end, which is somewhat larger, in order that the head my not obstruct the light, when the eye is applied at 'b', is supported by two sliding legs 'c', and 'd', which are lengthened or shortened by means of the thumb-pins 'e', 'f', shown more plainly in fig.2; a catgut cord passes from the thumb-pins down the front of the upper sliding rod, over a small pulley at 'g' and 'h', thence along a groove cut in the front surface of the lower sliding rod up to nearly its top at 'c' and 'd', where it is fastened; an iron hand attached to the top of the lower rod, and another attached to the bottom of the upper rod, holds the whole firmly, yet allows a free movement when they are made to slide upon each other by winding or unwinding the cat-gut cord upon the barrel of the thumb-pins 'e' and 'f'. The lower ends of the sliding rods are pointed and armed with iron, and at the lower end of the upper part of the sliding rods, camping screws are placed, just below the pulleys in order that the whole may be securely fastened while being transported from place to place. The method of attachment to the upper end of the tube is shown in fig. 2, a brass saddle 'i', is bolted to the tube, between the ears of which the parallel plates of brass 'k', 'l', move freely upon the pin 'm' 'n', between these plates of brass, the sliding legs are placed, and turn upon the two pins 'o', 'p'. It will be perceived, that by extending the sliding legs at the bottom, or by lengthening or shortening them, almost any required altitude may be given to the telescope, and to keep the thumb-pins 'e' and 'r', from unwinding with the weight of the telescope, two pieces of hard wood 'r', and 's', are located below them, having a steadying pin at the bottom and a clamping screw at the top as shown in fig. 2, by turning this clamping screw the smooth flange of the thumb-pins is pinched between the rod and bit of wood, and thus any requisite amount of friction is obtained. The eye-piece is located at 'b', fig. 1, and screws or slips into a ring attached to a bar, which is racked, and the proper position for distinct vision is obtained by means of the milled head. The finder 'u' is a small telescope mounted upon two pins, which pass through elongated holes in the tube, and by means of nuts which screw upon the pins outside and inside of the tube, is held firmly, and adjusted, so that when any object is brought upon the intersection of the hairs in the focus of the eye-piece, it will be in the field of view in the telescope. The stand I have now described is remarkably steady, since the speculum, which forms the image, rests upon the ground.<br>

			<div class='panel'>
				<p>Morse's mount deserves wider attention. Here is a representation of his design as described in Scientific American, June, 1942, Ingalls and pictured in Henry Paul's, 'Telescopes for Skygazing'.

				<p>A curved arc in the shape of a sickle attached to a tracking cylinder tracks the telescope's tube across the sky in an equatorial arc. The rear of the telescope's tube is clamped to the sickle by a trolley at the desired Declination. The telescope's tube pulls the altazimuth frame along with itself. The tracking cylinder is polar aligned with the polar axis cutting through the telescope tube's center of gravity. The tracking cyclinder only spins: since it is attached to the ground board it stays motionless while the rocker box rotates around it.

				<p>Long before there were computerized altazimuth drive systems for telescope mounts, the Morse mount mechanically translated equatorial motion to altazimuth motion.

				<p>As explained in the Scientific American article, the idea originated with A.B. Hendricks Jr of Pittsfield, Mass in 1936. Hendricks' idea was to link equatorial motion to an altazimuth mount. Upon seeing this in 1936, H.F. Morse of Southport, Connecticut devised an entirely different approach to the mechanical transformer.

				<p>He wrote that, 'The object was to avoid certain inherent shortcoming in large equatorial mountings. Estimates indicate a much lower cost. Materials could be better used-with lessened total weight. Because there would be no transfer of weight from one bearing to another, there would be no distortion of parts. Because of ease and flexibility of the adjustments, less precision work would be required on various details. Astronomers would work in an always level position and in a constant temperature room at either end of the horizontal axis, where light could be directed with three reflections. Because the tube moves about the horizontal axis in one plane alone, the tube could be made very rigid and at the same time relatively light. The whole instrument could be floated in an annular tank of mercury, thus leaving only enough weight on the annular track (precision ground) to insure accurate rotation around the vertical axis.'

				<p>A curved blade representing the Declination angle is attached to the polar axis drive which represents the hour angle. The telescope's axis below the tube is tied to the curved blade. The altazimuth axes intersect the polar axis. An equatorial tracking movement translates into altazimuth motions.

				<p>The Sketchup model can be found at <a href='https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/model/53af76a186e18e456ed97933d0fe8bb5/The-Morse-Equatorial-to-Altazimuth-Transformer-Telescope-Mount' target='_blank'>https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/model/53af76a186e18e456ed97933d0fe8bb5/The-Morse-Equatorial-to-Altazimuth-Transformer-Telescope-Mount</a><br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' src='MORSE\morse.jpg'><br>

				<p>And we can extend the Morse transformer to eliminate field rotation by using a three axis mount like this, showing one hour tracking. Note how the eyepiece angle is lifted up to follow the equatorial tracking arc as opposed to above where the eyepiece angle stays horizontal.<br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' src='MORSE\morse 3axis.jpg'>

				<br>The Great Paris Exhibition Telescope of 1900 also used an equatorial to altazimuth transformer called a Foucault Siderostat. See Wikipedia's <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Paris_Exhibition_Telescope_of_1900#/media/File:Great_Ex_Telescope_Design.jpg' target='_blank'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Paris_Exhibition_Telescope_of_1900#/media/File:Great_Ex_Telescope_Design.jpg</a>,
				and Journal of the British Astronomical Association, Vol. 95, NO.3/APR, P. 89, 1985 <a href='http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1985JBAA...95...89M' target='_blank'>http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1985JBAA...95...89M</a>.

				<p>Conceptually linked is the Earl of Crawford's tracking arm. The length of arm represents the Declination with the arm tying the polar axis to the tube's axis, resulting in an identical equatorial to altazimuth transformation.

				<p>Both equatorial axes and both altazimuth axes intersecting is an optimized design. I strongly suspect that the designers started with less optimal designs where the equatorial portion of the transformer was below or at the side of the altazimuth portion. This takes us back into the rich sophisticated world of analog devices and mechanical linkages. It also gives the modern day amateur new design possibilities.

				<p>After some thought, mental gymnastics and immersing myself in the mechanical analog world of linkages I devised an equatorial to altazimuth transformer where the equatorial portion is placed at the side of the altazimuth mount. Two disks, one  under the altazimuth mount and the other at the bottom of the equatorial section, rotate against each other such that the equatorial portion maintains its polar alignment. The altitude arm is coupled to the curved Declination arm. Just as in the Morse transformer proper, all four axes intersect at one point to the side of the rocker: altitude, azimuth, polar equatorial and Declination. Here I've scaled the polar portion smaller, albeit increasing leverage.<br>
				<br><img alt='' loading='lazy' src='MORSE\morse extended axes detail.jpg'><br>

				<p>As the equatorial portion tracks, it forces the altazimuth portion to track also. Interestingly, the equatorial portion could be set free to move as needed as the scope is aimed about the sky. This causes the equatorial portion to act as setting circles. In fact, the field rotation angle can be read too.

				<p>Here is the change in position after one hour of equatorial tracking. The equatorial portion maintains its polar alignment while the altazimuth portion is forced into tracking an equatorial tracking arc across the sky. This could be extended to a three axis mount if the Declination car is coupled tightly to the altitude extension.<br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' src='MORSE\morse extended.jpg'>

				<p>Here's the arc extended into an armillary sphere. Note that the telescope's pointing position has changed: the hour angle is increased, the Declination lowered, the altitude lowered and the azimuth increased.<br>

			<h4>Friction of movement discussion</h4>

			<p>An essential feature of John Dobson's telescope design is that the telescope moves smoothly and precisely about the sky, staying put once the operator let's go. There is no clamping or locking down. Tracking an object across the sky consists of periodic adjustments by pushing the scope very small distances while looking through the eyepiece. His design depends on an interesting property of Teflon on pebbly Formica, namely that the friction felt when moving the scope is about the same as the friction felt while starting the move. In other words, the dynamic friction equals static friction. Most materials stick worse than they move, leading to jerky motions.

			<p>The force to move the telescope should not be so great as to demand a great deal of effort, particularly when making very tiny high magnification adjustments by hand, nor should the force be so slight that wind can move the telescope. Ideally the force in both azimuth and altitude axes is roughly the same so that the axes 'disappear' as the scope is moved to and fro.

			<p>The force to move the scope in azimuth increases as the scope is pointed upward. I set the angle at 48 degrees or halfway up the sky. This is the optimum pointing angle given the range of altitude movement, area of sky and seeing conditions. Keep in mind that as the scope is pointed further upward that the azimuth resistance to movement becomes quite stiff.

			<p>I like a frictional force of two to three pounds (1 to 1.5 kilos); others prefer less friction. This gives me a smooth and not-too-stiff touch at the upper end of the scope, avoids balancing issues with heavy eyepieces and resists weathervaning from wind gusts.

			<p>The altitude friction can be adjusted by varying the bearing angle and the altitude bearing radius. The azimuth friction can be adjusted by varying the distance from the pads to the pivot (the azimuth bearing radius) and by changing the material pairing. Bearings can be substituted for one or more of the bearing points with a proportionate reduction in friction. For instance, the azimuth friction can be reduced by two-thirds if two of the three bearing pads are replaced with roller bearings. More unusual is to build a trolley with a pad on one end and a roller bearing on the other end. By moving the pivot location closer to the pad the friction can be increased and by moving the pivot location closer to the bearing the friction can be decreased.

			<p>The formula and concept is from Richard Berry's article in Telescope Making 8, page 36-.

			<p>The size of the pads modestly affects the quality of motion. It's a long standing rule of thumb that 15 PSI (pounds per square inch) is ideal.

			<p>The key here is to have a favorable static to dynamic friction ratio where the friction to begin the movement is less than the friction to continue the movement. This feels like 'butter' at the eyepiece.

			<p>Imagine the altitude bearing getting bigger and bigger. The rocker's weight shrinks, which is good but so does the height, lessening its rigidity, which is bad. But what if the altitude bearing points are placed at the rocker's corners and under each corner an azimuth bearing is placed resulting in four azimuth bearings that ride on a rigid ring? In fact, the altitude and azimuth bearings can be combined into a single block or post with the rocker reduced to merely holding the bearing blocks in relative position. The flex rocker strips away unnecessary weight and structure. We can have our ultralight rocker with good rigidity. Additionally, the mirror box can swing down through the base to lower eyepiece height when pointing near the zenith.

			<p>Here is a Google Sketchup of my ZipDobII, Joe Rotman's 16 inch [41cm] UltraLight, Greg Babcock's circular flex rocker 24 inch [61cm] ultralight and my 3 axis double flexing rocker on my 25 inch [64cm].<br>

			<p>The bending force on a post due to pushing the scope is:
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bending force = push needed to break static friction * altitude bearing radius / ratio of upper end to center of mass / 4
			<p>For example:
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bending force = 1.5 lbs * 23 / 12 / 4 = 0.7 lbs
			<p>These forces are very small, which is why thin spacer rods between posts is sufficient.

			<p>In order to keep the post height to a minimum, it is common for the azimuth bearings to sit on a rigid center-less base ring. This allows the mirror box to swing through the base. The eyepiece height above the ground when the scope is pointing upward is minimized when the mirror box sits inside the base ring just above the ground.

			<h4>Equatorial table discussion...</h4>

			<p>The polar axis must pass through the combined center of gravity of the tube assembly, rocker and the equatorial table's platform.
			<p>Values for a four corner equatorial table are calculated where a tracking arc is situated at each corner of the equatorial table.
			<p>Other table designs include three arcs (two on the north side of the platform, one on the south side), two arcs on the north side and a pivot on the south side, and finally, two pivots, one on the north side and one on the south side.

				<p>I'm fascinated by the equatorial table, or <b>Poncet Platform</b>, ever since it was invented in the late 1970's by Adrian Poncet. The platform's versatility has been proven by its use from small table top telescopes to giant telescopes - even an entire observatory building!

				<p>While the polar alignment has not proven too difficult, the equatorial table suffers from a serious limitation: it's built to a specific latitude. Traveling north or south a few hundred miles to a major star party means uncomfortably tipping the platform up on edge. Is there anything that can be done about this limitation?

				<p><b>Jerry Oltion's Trackball </b>cleverly uses a single roller aligned parallel to the polar axis pressed against the bottom of the ballscope. A single tracking roller that is slid along a curved holder based on the site's latitude

				<p><a href='http://www.sff.net/people/j.oltion/trackball.htm' target='_blank'>http://www.sff.net/people/j.oltion/trackball.htm</a>

				<p>Jerry's mounting design could be trimmed down into a hemisphere, resulting in an equatorial table platform. For moderate latitudes the drive arm rises above the two rollers.

				<p><b>My idea is that the curved pads cut out from a hemisphere can be driven by two rollers working on two lines of latitude; each wheel rotates at its own unique constant rate.</b> The drives rates depend on the site's latitude. Changing latitude is a matter of resetting the wheels' drive rates.

				<p>For example, let's say that the drive wheels' diameter is 1.5 inches [4cm] and that the virtual ball's diameter is 20 inches [51cm]. For the placement of the drive wheels and pads shown the drive rates for a site of 45 degrees latitude are:<br>
				pole facing motor: 20 inches / 1.5 inches * sin(line of latitude of 75 deg) * 1.002737909 sidereal rate / 1440 minutes per day = <b>0.0090 rpm</b><br>
				side facing motor: 20 inches / 1.5 inches * sin(line of latitude of 35 deg) * 1.002737909 sidereal rate / 1440 minutes per day = <b>0.0053 rpm</b><br>
				and for a site of 30 degrees latitude are:<br>
				pole facing motor: 20 inches / 1.5 inches * sin(line of latitude of 90 deg) * 1.002737909 sidereal rate / 1440 minutes per day = <b>0.0093 rpm</b><br>
				side facing motor: 20 inches / 1.5 inches * sin(line of latitude of 45 deg) * 1.002737909 sidereal rate / 1440 minutes per day = <b>0.0066 rpm</b>

				<p><b>Here you can see the concept.</b> Note how the platforms for site latitude of 45 degrees and site latitude of 30 degrees are identical; the only difference being that the two drive motors operate at different rates causing the platform to track on different lines of latitude.<br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' src='et\et level.jpg'>

				<p>Here is what the platforms for latitudes of 45 and 30 degrees respectively look like at the <b>end of an hour of tracking</b>.<br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' src='et\et end.jpg'>

				<p><b>There is a slight difference in the platforms' ending angle.</b> The platform on the left tracked for site latitude of 45 degrees, which the platform on the right tracked tracked for a site latitude of 30 degrees.<br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' src='et\et ending position for 45 deg and 30 deg latitudes.jpg'>

				<p>The drive wheels will need to be made from hard plastic, possibly with a thin ribber O-ring to generate friction. The friction is needed to resist sliding as the telescope sitting on the platform is pushed about the sky.

				<p>The tradeoff for the omni-latitude table is two fold:<br>
				1. Two motors that rotate at constant rates, the rates varying per the site's latitude<br>
				2. The need to grind or sand the curved pads in two dimensions; many equatorial tables have their curved tracking surfaces ground in one dimension, this has to be expanded to two dimensions.

				<p>Other inspirations include <b>Alphonse Pouplier's 'Robotic Astroscan'</b> (see Sky and Telescope magazine, August 1993) where he uses two tracking wheels that sidereally track and provide goto motions for a ballscope. And Pierre LeMay's dual tracking roller platform places both rollers at the same line of latitude. Conceptually it appears more in line with Jerry's thinking than with the dual great circle tracker here. More can be found on Jerry Oltion's webpage noted above.

				<h4>Why does a telescope need to track?</h4>

				<p>Because the Earth rotates once every day, the stars at night appear to move across the sky in arcs. The telescope needs to follow the stars. We call this sidereal tracking or equatorial motion.

				<p>Equatorial mounts were invented to easily track the stars by rotating a polar axis at a slow constant rate (atmospheric refraction causes the tracking rate to slow ever so slightly near the horizons).

				<p>But the tipped polar axis in an equatorial mount adds bulk to the telescope and the popular German equatorial design requires counterweights, making transport and setup in the dark oftentimes a real chore.

				<p>Consequently much thought and innovation has gone into alternatives that imitate equatorial motion.

				<p>The altazimuth mount is often a more transportable and stable design but suffers from continuously varying tracking rates and field rotation at the eyepiece or camera. The Dobsonian, depending on your point of view, is either free from the complications that come with tracking devices, or is handicapped because the object drifts out of the field of view too quickly at higher magnifications.

				<h4>The Poncet Platform and the Equatorial Table</h4>

				<p>A significant advance occurred in the 1976 with the invention by Adrien Poncet of the tracking platform, originally called a Poncet Table, but now more often called an equatorial table. He reasoned that if the astronomer was willing to accept limiting sidereal tracking time to say an hour before having to start over, then a flat platform could be devised that imparts equatorial motion to any telescope placed on top. Subsequently the Poncet Table evolved into what we call equatorial platforms that better support heavy telescopes and track more accurately.

				<p>All tracking tables suffer from the restriction that they are custom built to specific latitudes. I've worked to overcome this restriction with my omni-latitude table. <a href='NewtDesigner.html#omniLatitudeET' target='_blank'>Continue reading...</a>

				<p>Designers invariably think of equatorial tables in terms of limited equatorial motion. The English Yoke mounting becomes the Alan Gee design with a pivot point and cylindrical bearing sector. The Horseshoe equatorial mount (think Palomar 200 inch telescope) becomes the modern equatorial table with dual cylindrical bearing surfaces.

				<p>But can a table that imitates equatorial motion such that it supports a telescope aimed in any desired direction be built from different motions, different placement of axes? Let's investigate.

				<h4>The Bartels Turret Table</h4>

				<p>Can an equatorial platform be devised using the well understood altazimuth Dobsonian design where the primary axis, aimed straight upward, spins like a platter and the secondary axis pivots at right angles much like a crane going up and down? We should only need a snippet of limited motion in both directions, potentially an easy to build design. We know conceptually that a three axis mount can perfectly imitate sidereal tracking motion and that the three axes can be arbitrarily aimed anywhere and in any order of preference. Is there a solution where a limited tracking time and a vertically oriented axis can be found such that the third axis can be foregone such that motion in only two axes is necessary? It is said that constraints help problem solving. I'm about to find out if that is true here.

				<p>I'll use Sketchup, a free CAD program, to help picture the platform as it goes through its three dimensional motions. I'll snapshot the platform as it begins tracking, and then take a second snapshot after one hour of sidereal tracking motion. I'll then experiment with moving the snapshots around in order to find two axes of limited motion, one axis aimed upward and the other aimed sideways, just like a Dobsonian telescope.

				<p>Any flat table, as long as it pivots around the polar axis, will allow a telescope placed on top to be aimed anywhere in the sky and continue to track equatorially.

				<p>Here's the flat table oriented flat to the ground for a latitude of 45 degrees.<br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' class='mediumSizeImage' src='et\MET flat table.jpg'><br>

				Now I'll rotate it through a half hour of sidereal tracking each way. The three snapshots like this.<br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' class='mediumSizeImage' src='et\MET 3 tables plus minus half hour tracking closeup.jpg'><br>

				As long as their orientation is not changed, we are free to reposition the tables as desired, so I'll place them so that a common point in their centers that represents a vertical axis of rotation. The tables intersect like this.<br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' class='mediumSizeImage' src='et\MET common vertical axis.jpg'><br>

				Here are the three tables from their south end: the first set the starting orientation, the second set a half hour into the tracking (the table is flat to the ground) and the final set an hour into the tracking, showing equal and opposite tip to the starting orientation.<br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' class='mediumSizeImage' src='et\MET 2 axis 3 plates 1 hr tracking 45 deg latitude.jpg'><br>

				The azimuth axis rotates +- 5 degrees as does the altitude axis. There is a slight tip to the azimuth axis of 0.6 degrees over the hour of tracking. That means a +- error in the eyepiece of 1/3 degree. For this to be an issue, the table will have to be polar aligned to 1/3 degree accuracy.

				<p>For latitudes closer to the pole the azimuth rotates more and the altitude roates less; the reverse occurs for shallower latitudes.

				<p>For a half hour of tracking, these numbers are halved.

				<p>The drive rates should vary by +- 2% causing a fraction of a degree positional error, but can be ignored for visual high magnification use.

				<p>The pluses of this design is that simple Dobsonian styled bearings can be used. The disadvantage is that the scope will tip a bit off-balance. The top plate will need springs to counteract the tendency to tipping.

				<p>There are other placements of the axes that can be studied also, but they are similar in nature.

				<p>So there's the result of my design process. Onto other ideas, looking for constraints that lead to good solutions.

			<button class='accordion' id='btnTiltET'>A tilt equatorial table</button>
			<div class='panel'>
				<p>An equatorial table is a specially designed platform that allows any telescope sitting on it to follow the stars, just like a traditional equatorial mount.

				<p>The suggestion has been made over the years that tilting a table screws will also work. Richard Berry suggested this soon after the Poncet Platform was invented. There are two versions, the hexapod and the jack-screw.

				<p>We know that the hexapod works because the table can be made to rotate as well as tip in two axis, equivalent to a three axis mounting. Any three axis mount can simulate equatorial tracking motion with no field rotation. <a href='http://legacy.nrao.edu/alma/memos/html-memos/abstracts/abs263.html' target='_blank'>Jeff Kingsley proposed a hexapod mount for a radio telescope</a>. A hexapod 1.5 meter (60 inch) Ritchey-Chretien was built in 1999 for the Bochum - UNC observatory in Chile.<br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' class='mediumSizeImage' src='et\60 inch hexpod telescope Bochum UCN observatory Chile.jpg'>

				<p>But what about a table that sits on three jack screws, not the six extending arms of a hexapod? The Oregon Scope Werks group decided to investigate this possibility. Here is my analysis and results.

				<p>Let's start by taking a platform and rotate it about a polar axis, aimed upward at 45 degrees (equivalent to an equatorial mount placed at a latitude of 45 degrees on Earth) simulating motion required for tracking. Jerry Oltion and I did this with cardboard and chopsticks (images by his wife, Kathy). (I recommend working through the problem with a buddy - the visualizations are non-trivial). The chopstick held in my hand (and hidden from the camera) on the right hand side in the images represent the polar axis. The chopstick that points out and away represents a telescope pointing south on the meridian. Jerry on the left is working to tilt a tracking platform to match the equatorial tracking table that I'm operating on the right.

				<p>The first image shows that the platforms are level with each other and that the telescopes on both platforms point to the same position in the sky. The second image shows one hour worth of tracking. Note that Jerry has had to tip his platform a fair amount so that both telescopes are pointed in the same direction. The final image shows the tilt table after two hours of tracking. Jerry has had to tip the platform a good deal to maintain the same telescope pointing angle.<br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' class='mediumSizeImage' src='et\Tilt_vs_EQ_left.JPG'>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' class='mediumSizeImage' src='et\Tilt_vs_EQ_mid.JPG'>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' class='mediumSizeImage' src='et\Tilt_vs_EQ_right.JPG'>

				<p>Let's also model this in Sketchup.

				<p>Here's an equatorial platform showing one hour tracking at latitude of 45 degrees. The scope is aimed to the south-east, about 25 degrees up and 25 degrees over.<br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' class='mediumSizeImage' src='et\tilt table one hour tracking.jpg'>

				<p>Next let's align the platforms at a common point for convenience's sake and add three tip-tilt points underneath.<br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' class='mediumSizeImage' src='et\tilt tables at common point.jpg'>

				<p>Now let's align the two telescopes to point in the same direction using only the three tilts afforded us. Oops, the lines representing pointing to the pole no longer are coincident. That means that the tilt movements must vary depending on telescope pointing angle at the start of tracking.<br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' class='mediumSizeImage' src='et\two tables aligned telescopes.jpg'>

				<p>A closeup shows that significant field rotation (25.8 degrees) has occurred during the one hour of tracking.<br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' class='mediumSizeImage' src='et\field rotation closeup.jpg'>

				<p>Let's see how much each tip point traversed for the one hour of tracking. The three tips changed 14.7 degrees, -3 degrees and -11.8 degrees.<br>
				<img alt='' loading='lazy' class='mediumSizeImage' src='et\tips movement for one hour tracking.jpg'>

				<h3>Conclusions:</h3>
				1. A Tilted Equatorial Table can track.<br>
				2. The tilts required are significant.<br>
				3. Field rotation is significant.<br>
				4. Different amounts of tilt will be required depending on telescope pointing direction.<br>
				5. Therefore the tip rates will vary as the platform tracks across the sky.

				<p><b>Any platform that tips on an axis different than the polar axis and that cannot rotate will encounter field rotation, varying speeds of tilt and different amounts of needed tip depending on telescope pointing direction. <p>Since the hexapod can rotate as well as tip, it can negate field rotation. Since field rotation is constrained, the initial telescope pointing direction no longer matters. The same changes in the hexapod leg lengths can be used over and over again, just like an equatorial table is reset to track again, regardless of initial telescope pointing angle.</b>
