				<p>No single telescope does it all. Larger aperture reveals dimmer objects but narrows the field of view increasing the  scope's weight and eyepiece height. A larger diagonal promises more light to the edge of the field, but itself blocks more light at the center of the field.</p>
				<p>What telescope is best for you depends on ergonomic factors, budget, your expertise and what you want from the telescope. I use 'NewtDesigner' to carefully design my telescopes. Besides calculations, I also look at options. Perhaps you'll find NewtDesigner useful too.</p>

			<div>
				<p><b>Focal length</b> is the distance that the primary mirror uses to bring the light to focus. Focal ratio times aperture also gives the focal length.<br>
				In many ways, the focal length sets the power of the telescope. Focal length sets the length of the telescope. Longer focal length telescopes are heavier thus more difficult to transport. Focal lengths greater than 60-70 inches [150-175cm] require a step stool or ladder to reach the eyepiece.<br>
				Since mirrors typically come in a limited range of focal ratios, the focal length sets the range of mirror sizes.<br>
				And the focal length along with the set of eyepieces determine the magnification range of the telescope along with the field of view.</p>

				<p><b>Aperture</b> is the mirror diameter, determining the star magnitude reach of the telescope.<br>
				Aperture sets the maximum possible resolution.<br>
				Aperture also sets the image scale. For example, given the same focal ratio and eyepiece, a 20 inch aperture telescope shows an extended object, for example a galaxy, at twice the apparent size of a 10 inch aperture telescope. Our eyes can more readily detect larger apparent sized objects and detail is more visible.</p>

				<p><b>Focal ratio</b> is the speed of the telescope and is found by diving the focal length by the mirror diameter.</p>
				<p>Slower speeds of <b>F7-F8</b> favor resolution with higher magnifications in longer tube lengths. Slower speeds have little or no coma, do not require precise alignment and have a relaxed focusing tolerance.<br>
				<b>F5-F6</b> are general purpose focal ratios.<br>
				Faster speeds of <b>F3-F4</b> favor wider fields with lower magnifications in shorter tube lengths. Faster speeds also have more coma, require more precise optical alignment and have a tight focusing tolerance.
				<p>F3 allows the use of 100 degree apparent field of view eyepieces at lowest power for widest field and greatest light throughput or highest <b>etendue</b>. Etendue is the total amount of light flowing into your eye. Etendue is calculated as aperture squared times real field of view squared. A <b>coma corrector</b> is required at F3, recommended at F4 and not useful at F5 and slower.</p>

				<h4>Faster focal ratios</h4>

				<p>My 24 inch [61cm] F5.5 weighing 350 pounds that I finished in 1982 required a 10 foot aluminum ladder. The ladder is tiring to stand on and has to be moved constantly as the telescope tracks. And I could only take up to the focuser the eyepieces, filters and sketching equipment that I could carry in my pockets. I dreaded the accidental eyepiece impact test. In contrast using my 25 inch [64cm] F2.6 weighing 75 pounds that I finished in 2018 I observe sitting in my observing chair or standing on the ground with my eyepieces, filters and sketching equipment on a table next to me. The images are approximately at equal scale.</p>
				<img alt='' src='24 inch aimed high.jpg'> <img alt='' src='25/ready for 1st light Aug 4 2018.jpg'>

				<h4>Aperture implications</h4>

				<p>Let's consider relative brightness, focal ratio, resolution, seeing and ergonomic factors like telescope length and weight (2.5 power of the aperture). Here is the plot of all these factors together for apertures from 4 inches to 30 inches.</p>
				<img alt='' src='ApertureImplications.jpg'>
				<p>Brightness increases proportionally with the mirror's area while resolution increases linearly with the mirror's diameter, subject to severe seeing effects in the larger apertures. All other factors trend negatively with increasing mirror size: ergonomically, telescope weight increases at the 2.5 power of the aperture and focal ratio decreases strongly as aperture grows for feet-on-the-ground observing (otherwise a ladder is needed).</p>

				<ul>
					<li>The leftmost vertical line represents the historically popular 6 inch telescope. Note that it is the lightest weight, can be made in long focal ratios and tube lengths and is not generally limited by seeing. The 6 inch has three highly positive and two negative attributes distributed across a wide range.
					<li>The next vertical line represents a popular large scope size of 12 inches aperture. It's heavier, can be made up to F6 focal ratio though affected by seeing. The 12 inch has four attributes tightly grouped with a favorable ergonomic attribute.
					<li>The third vertical line from the left is the most popular very large scope size: 16 inches aperture. It's heavier yet, can be made to F4 focal ratio (thus not needing a ladder or coma corrector) and is limited by seeing. The 16 inch favors relative brightness with an increasing ergonomic cost; apertures up to 20 inches look similar but at increasing ergonomic cost.
					<li>The rightmost vertical line represents the largest scope size commonly seen in large star parties, 25 inches aperture. While the greatest brightness, all other factors are trending badly negative: very heavy, needs a fast focal ratio, requires a ladder and is strongly limited by seeing. The 25 inch favors relative brightness at the cost of four negative attributes.
				</ul>

				<h4>Comparing apertures at the eyepiece</h4>

				<img alt='' src='Sombrero Galaxy through 6 and 13 inch telescopes.jpg' class='imageTextWrap'>

				<p>I compare two telescopes, a 6 inch [15cm] and a 13 inch [34cm], and selected the galaxy, M104, the Sombrero Galaxy.</p>

				<p>The Sombrero Galaxy is 8th magnitude and about 9 by 4 arc-minutes in size, well within the grasp of both telescopes. The galaxy is representative of many objects visible in amateur telescopes. The 13 inch gathers 1.7 more magnitude of light than the 6 inch.</p>

				<p>If aperture is king then the view through the 13 inch should be vastly superior to the view through the 6 inch, given the same magnification, 55x, in both scopes. Surprisingly, that is not the case: the 6 inch is only somewhat inferior. This is also true at 150x, where the view through both scopes is noticeably better than at the lower magnification. Through the 6 inch the companion star was very faint and the nucleus non-existent. The star and nucleus was prominent in the 13 inch.</p>

				<p>This observation shows that a smaller scope can do nicely, given sufficient magnification. But how much magnification is best? Should it be limited to 4-5mm exit pupil as commonly recommended?</p>

				<p>Increasing magnification greatly enhances the view through both scopes. The Lowest power view for both scopes is 6mm exit pupil, medium power is 3mm exit pupil, and highest power is 1mm exit pupil. The best views occur at the highest magnifications. In fact, the view through the 13 inch at 320x is stunningly beautiful - now that's what visual observing is all about. This observation shows that <b>magnification for deep sky objects should not be restricted to 4-5mm exit pupil</b>, that in fact, high magnifications provide the best viewing.</p>

				<p>The 6 inch can be considered an extreme case of illumination drop-off compared to the 13 inch, in this case a drop-off of 1.7 magnitudes! Since the 6 inch is only somewhat inferior, then perhaps the <b>common advice that off-axis illumination drop-off should not exceed 0.3-0.4 magnitudes is too tight. A drop-off approaching a whole magnitude, considering that it is the edge of the field of view, is a better recommendation</b>. Why is this so? I suspect it is because both the object* and the sky background lose brightness equally, preserving the contrast between the two as the illumination drops off.</p>

				<p>*Technically, the sky background lies in front of the object, so contrast is actually sky background + object divided by sky background. The Sombrero Galaxy's brightness is ~20.5 mag/arc-second^2 while a country sky's brightness is ~21.5.</p>

			<div id='apertureManagement'></div>
			<h3>Aperture Management</h3>

			<p>Aperture management is changing the aperture to extend telescope performance. There are three categories of aperture management.</p>

			<ol>
				<li>By selecting an appropriate eyepiece, the telescope can achieve a lower magnification wider field with greater etendue.
				<li>Dealing with atmospheric turbulence
				<li>Envisioning a larger faster thinner primary mirror for a more versatile scope
			</ol>

			<p>Imagine a focal length, say 40 inches [102cm]. Focal length sets the telescope's length and greatly influences the telescope's weight. This length of telescope will fit across the back seats of most passenger cars and can be carried by most amateur astronomers. Let's consider a 10 inch [25cm] F4, a middle of the road aperture and focal ratio choice. The widest angle eyepiece that fits a 6mm exit pupil gives a 2.1 degree true field of view.</p>

			<p><b>1)</b> We achieve a wider field with greater etendue by managing the aperture. Using a 42mm eyepiece with an apparent field of view of 72 degrees, we get a true field of view of 3.0 degrees. But what to do with the 10.5mm exit pupil? The answer is managing the aperture by stopping down to 6 inches [15cm] lowering the exit pupil to 6.3mm.The true field area doubles from 3.5 square degrees to 7 square degrees. Note that faster scopes are more extensible to lower magnification wider fields than slower scopes.</p>
			<p>2.1 and 3 degree fields compared<br>
			<img alt='' src='2.1 and 3 degree fields compared.jpg'></p>

			<p><b>2)</b> Turbulence in the upper atmosphere due to variations in the density (humid air weighs less) of air manifests itself as a quivering image in smaller apertures and a blobby boiling image with larger apertures. While typically more detail is visible with larger apertures, the image can be less aesthetically appealing. By managing aperture we stop down the mirror until the image aesthetic is acceptable commiserate with detectible detail. In fact, with very large apertures we can utilize an off-axis mask using light that goes between the spider vanes resulting in an unobstructed view. For example, a 25 inch [64cm] telescope with a 5 inch [13cm] secondary can have a 10 inch [25cm] unobstructed aperture. On any given night, each planet has its optimal magnification where apparent size is balanced with seeing. And each planet has its optimal aperture.</p>
			<p>A professional study in the 1950's looked at two optimizations: what aperture is best for highest resolution viewing the majority of the time and what aperture will give the highest resolution view regardless of how long the observer has to wait for a moment of clarity. The answers are 11 inches [28cm] and 16 inches [41cm]. This matches well in the field of high resolution digital imaging where the best amateurs use apertures up to 16 inches, discarding the inferior images, and matches well with anecdotal amateur thinking that up to 12 inches is the optimal aperture for planetary viewing though larger apertures display better views at certain times.</p>
			<p>For a detailed discussion of atmospheric turbulence, see my article on <a href='Seeing and Atmospheric Turbulence.html'>Seeing and Atmospheric Turbulence</a> and read MacEvoy's Astronomical Seeing <a href='http://www.handprint.com/ASTRO/seeing1.html'>part 1</a>, <a href='http://www.handprint.com/ASTRO/seeing2.html'> part 2</a> and <a href='http://www.handprint.com/ASTRO/seeing3.html'> part 3</a>.</p>
			<p>Unobstructed off-axis mask arrangement<br>
			<img alt='' src='offset axis aperture layout.jpg'></p>

			<p><b>3)</b> Finally we imagine squeezing our 10 inch [25cm] mirror into a thinner faster mirror of greater aperture, for example, a 15 inch [38cm] F2.7 of same focal length. Then we have a series of apertures from 5 inch [13cm] unobstructed off-axis to the full 15 inches [38cm] that we can use to manage for best view in the eyepiece.</p>
			<p>Comparing 10 inch [25cm] standard thickness F4 to 15 inch [38cm] thin meniscus (mirror weighs but 20% more) F2.7 with identical 40 inch [102cm] focal lengths<br>
			<img alt='' src='10 inch F4 and 15 inch F2.7 mirrors.jpg'></p>

			<div id='telescopePerformance'></div>
			<h3>Telescope performance</h3>

			<p>Five factors dominate telescope performance:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Thermal effects in the primary mirror. If the mirror is not at air temperature, the glass can distort and the air just in front of the mirror will boil.
				<li>Optical alignment.
				<li>Seeing: the quality of the atmosphere immediately surrounding the telescope and the turbulence of the upper atmosphere.
				<li>Mirror cells: most hold the mirror without strain or distortion. I've witnessed more badly built mirror cells that deform the optics than poor mirrors.
				<li>Optical quality: optical quality in the modern era is good and is invariably a non-issue though often mistaken for other more dominate factors.
			</ol>
			<p>The factors be judged at the eyepiece with the star test, a subjective and sensitive test, that works by dynamically examining the distribution of light. For more <a href='JoyOfMirrorMaking/StarTesting.html'>see my star test page</a>.</p>

			<p>Telescope Value is the overall value of the telescope to the owner.</p>

			<p>Aperture is so important that we amateurs talk about aperture fever. I can see more with a bigger scope: objects are brighter and more detailed. Yet aperture isn't the only factor...</p>

			<p>Larger apertures have smaller fields of view. Many Milky Way objects such as bright and dark nebulae profit from a field of view of several degrees, whereas that one meter 40 inch telescope that we all lust after has a low power field closer to half a degree. Field of view trades off with aperture.</p>

			<p>Eyepieces, filters and accessories function to enhance viewing, and sometimes are indispensable, for instance, a nebula filter in light polluted skies.</p>

			<p>Usability or ergonomics sadly is often ignored. We don't think of the sore neck or strained back that can result from an uncomfortable eyepiece angle or lifting a heavy telescope into the back of a car. Well thought through ergonomics can enhance viewing: sitting on an astronomer's chair while observing allows me to concentrate on difficult details.</p>

			<p>Dark skies with good transparency and excellent seeing can make all the difference. They allow small scopes to achieve what large scopes can show in light polluted skies. Rare nights of perfect seeing when astonishing magnification can be used stay with me for years.</p>

			<p>The experience of the observer is a major factor. An experienced observer will see more with a smaller scope than a newbie with a larger scope.</p>

			<h4>Function (usability) is not only ergonomics but also TTO and TEO.</h4>

			<p>TTO is Total Time to Observe. TEO is Total Effort to Observe.</p>

			<p>I'm not talking telescope setup time or time to locate an object.</p>

			<p>TTO is the time from first thinking about observing to the initial looks through the eyepiece. The shorter this time, the more I observe. TEO is all the effort I have to put forth leading up to looking through the eyepiece.</p>

			<img alt='' src='TTO.jpg'>

			<p>The sky clears as I eat dinner. It would sure be great to take advantage of the sky. The quicker and easier that I can setup in the driveway or backyard, or throw the scope in the back of the car and drive to a nearby observing point, the more likely I'll observe that night.</p>

			<p>Sure, that big aperture scope is wonderful, but the truth is that I'm not as likely to go to the hassle of lugging it out and setting it up if it is heavy or has a lot of pieces, or needs tweaking every time. I did myself a huge favor and built a couple of smaller aperture scopes that setup instantly and that are a joy to point and look. A four, six or eight inch scope, quick to setup, is perfect. I reserve my big gun for those times when it is OK for my TTO to be long and for my TEO to be heavy, like a major star party or a long weekend trip to very dark skies.<p>

			<p>Do yourself a favor too by shortening your TTO. Oh, and lighten up that TEO while you are at it too!</p>

			<h4>Notes</h4>

			<p>Stellar limiting magnitude is calculated for low power via the equation, 9.8 + 5 * log10(aperture inches). An additional magnitude or more can be gained by going to high power.</p>

			<p>Imperfect focus worsens the wave rating of the optical system. Allowable focus tolerance is set to 1/4 wavefront.</p>

			<p>The coma free diameter is the field diameter where deformation caused by coma is less than the Airy disk diameter. Using a coma corrector greatly increases the coma free field diameter.</p>

			<h4>Definitions</h4>

			<b>True field of view</b> is the angle of the sky as seen through the eyepiece when used with the telescope.<br>
			<b>Eyepiece focal length</b> is the distance from the entrance of the eyepiece (where the parallel rays of light begin to converge) to its focal point.<br>
			<b>Eyepiece field stop</b> is the entrance to the eyepiece (ring inside the barrel) that limits the apparent field.<br>
			<b>Eye pupil</b> is the diameter of the opening of the eye's iris.<br>
			<b>Resolution</b> is the limit to discern detail, e.g., a double star or lunar feature.<br>
			<b>Magnitude limit</b> is the faintest star that can be seen given the aperture and magnification.<br>
			<b>Etendue or luminance</b> is the flux or total light flowing into the eye.<br>
			<b>Coma or comatic aberration</b> is the distortion of off-axis detail due to the primary mirror's paraboloidal shape,, i.e., stars appear to have a tail or coma.

			<h4>Exit pupil</h4>

			<p>The exit pupil, sometimes called the Ramsden disc, is the disc of light that floats above an eyepiece. You can see this circle of light when the scope is pointed at a bright sky. This is where the eye should be placed for viewing through the eyepiece. The exit pupil is the real image of the primary mirror formed by the eyepiece and is also the virtual aperture: only light that passes through this disc can be seen by the eye. The exit pupil is found by dividing the eyepiece focal length by the focal ratio of the primary mirror, for example, a 30mm eyepiece with an F5 mirror produces a 6mm exit pupil.</p>

			<p>Wider exit pupils are associated with lower power and brighter fields; narrow exit pupils with high power and dimmer fields. Be careful not to confuse the size of the exit pupil with the apparent field of view. Using the example above with a F5 mirror, a 30mm eyepiece with apparent field of view of 40 degrees produces the same exit pupil as a 30mm eyepiece iwth 80 degrees apparent field of view. However, the 80 degree apparent field eyepiece will produce 4x the light flux or etendue compared to the 40 degree apparent field of view eyepiece.</p>

			<p><b>Etendue or luminance</b> is the flux gathering capability of the telescope. The greater the aperture and the greater the true field of view, the greater the luminance, or light flowing through the telescope. Luminance is simply the mirror's diameter in centimeters squared times the true field in degrees squared (cm^2deg^2). A difference of 20% is probably the minimally meaningful change. There is room to improve luminance in popular amateur telescope designs.</p>

			<p>Since the eye's pupil also forms an aperture, etendue or luminance can also be calculated by squaring the eye's pupil in cm times the square of the eyepiece's apparent field of view in degrees (cm^2deg^2). From this perspective we see that etendue or luminance is ultimately limited by only two factors: the eye's pupil and the eyepiece's apparent field of view.</p>

			<p><a href='HET.html'>Go here for more information on my high etendue telescopes</a>.</p>

			<p>Brightest fields are obtained when the exit pupil matches your eye's pupil. The eye can resolve the aperture's potential resolution when exit pupil is approximately 1mm.</p>

			<p>This graph demonstrates that eyepieces with larger apparent fields allow greater aperture for a given real field.</p>

			<h4>Some thoughts on magnification</h4>

			<p>A range of magnifications is key to using a telescope properly.</p>

			<p><b>Magnification</b> is the ratio of the apparent size to actual size of an object. For example, looking through a magnifying lens the spider appears three times bigger. That's a magnification of 3x.</p>

			<p>Magnification depends on <b>telescope focal length</b> and <b>eyepiece focal length</b>. <b>Calculate magnification</b> by dividing the telescope focal length by the eyepiece focal length. For example, a 6 inch or 15cm telescope of 48 inches focal length used with a 9mm eyepiece yields a magnification of 48 inches * 25.4mm per inch / 9mm = 135x.</p>

			<p><b>Astronomical objects</b> are very far away and very faint. Both magnification and aperture are needed to view and image objects.</p>

			<p>Astronomical objects are either <b>point sources</b> like stars, too small in diameter to ever be resolved in a telescope, or <b>extended sources</b> like nebulae.</p>

			<p>There is a <b>practical limit</b> to both lowest magnification and highest magnification.</p>

			<p>The <b>lowest magnification</b> is simply the ratio of the telescope's aperture to the eye's dark adapted pupil. The lowest possible magnification for a 6 inch or 15cm aperture is 6 inches * 25.4mm/inch / 7mm eye-pupil = 22x.</p>

			<p>A useful <b>highest magnification</b> is the magnification where the eye's resolving power is fully utilized. A telescope's resolution is limited by interference caused by the aperture. The interference creates a disk of light surrounded by ever fainter rings of light. The radius of this Airy Disk is ~ 1.2 times the wavelength of light divided by the aperture. For a 6 inch or 15cm aperture scope the Airy Disk is 0.75 arc-seconds. The eye can resolve 120 arc-seconds. The magnification that matches the eye's resolution to the telescope's resolution is 120 arc-seconds divided by 6 inches aperture or roughly 27x per inch of aperture (roughly 68x per cm of aperture).</p>

			<p>Some observers prefer up to <b>twice this amount</b> so that the eye isn't strained (54x per inch of aperture or 136x per cm of aperture).</p>

			<p>Magnification above this is termed <b>empty magnification</b>: the object is made larger but nothing more can be resolved. In certain cases such as double star observing increasing magnification above this amount makes measuring the separation between the stars easier, but otherwise the image becomes softer, fuzzier and displeasing to the eye.</p>

			<p>Shimmering in the atmosphere, called <b>seeing</b> also limits magnification. If the jet stream is overhead or the upper atmosphere otherwise disturbed, magnification can be limited to 250x regardless of aperture. Steadier nights allow for increased magnification. The number of nights where 500x or higher can be employed are few and highly prized by observers. Nights where 2000x and higher can be used come very rarely. For example see <a href='6000X.html'>The Night of 6000x at the 1997 Oregon Star Party</a>. For more on seeing and the atmosphere, see my article on <a href='Seeing and Atmospheric Turbulence.html'> atmospheric turbulence</a>.</p>

			<p><b>Stars</b> (other than our Sun) are so far away that they are not resolvable regardless of magnification. They remain point sources. Extended objects (Moon, Sun, planets, nebulae, galaxies), however, are resolvable. As magnification increases, their light is spread over a larger area, decreasing brightness at any single point. The Moon, Sun and planets are so bright that increasing magnification doesn't consign them to invisibility. <b>Nebulae and galaxies</b> are a different matter.</p>

			<p>Let's use the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy' target='_blank'>Andromeda Galaxy</a>, visible as an elongated smear in dark skies to the unaided-eye. It's about 3x1 degrees apparent size with an integrated or overall magnitude of 3.5. The galaxy has an average surface brightness of 22.2 magnitudes per arc-second square. Let's use our 6 inch, 15cm, aperture at lowest magnification of 22x. At 22x the Andromeda Galaxy now appears 66x22 degrees in size and will comfortably fit within a 80 degree field of view eyepiece. The telescope brightens the galaxy by the ratio of the square of the telescope's aperture to the eye's aperture, or (6 inches of aperture * 25.4 mm/inch / 7mm eye-pupil) squared or 484 times. But the magnification of 22x decreases the object's brightness by the identical 484 times amount, leaving the apparent average surface brightness unchanged at 22.2 magnitudes per arc-second. Yet the view through the 6 inch is immeasurably richer. Why?</p>

			<p>Balancing aperture with magnification is as if a rocket ship takes us 22 times closer. We see more detail and the object overall is much brighter. But fly too close and the eyepiece can no longer fit the object into the field of view. Using the same telescope at increasing magnification means more detail at the cost of brightness. See my comparison of the Sombrero Galaxy, M104, with 6 inch and 13 inch telescopes at <a href='Is Aperture King.html'> is aperture king?</a></p>

			<h4>Table of lowest and highest magnifications per aperture.</h4>

			<p>Lowest magnification is given for 7mm and 5mm pupils, older people's eyes being closer to 5mm. Magnifications greater than 250x may be limited by seeing conditions.</p>

			<h4>Choosing magnification and aperture.</h4>

			<p><b>Saturn</b>. Since Saturn is a planet, select for highest useful magnification for your telescope, given seeing conditions. For example at my home, some of time I can I am limited to 250x, sometimes I can get up to 500x, occasionally I can reach 1000x before the image turns fuzzy thanks to seeing.</p>

			<p><b>North American Nebula</b>. The NAN is an extended wide field object, spanning 120 arc-minutes.</p>

			<p>Compute the highest magnification such that the entire object plus a border fits into the eyepiece. For this we need to know your eyepiece's apparent field of view.</p>

			<p><b>Dumbbell Nebula</b>. This planetary nebula is a favorite of observers. Its size is about 8 arc-minutes. Enter its size in the calculator above. The calculator will give a value of 240x-600x depending on the eyepiece's apparent field of view. The calculator will also give an aperture value far greater than your telescope. In this situation, use the largest aperture you have, setting its magnification to the calculated amount.</p>

			<p>If the object is too faint, then use a slightly lower magnification. If the object is too fuzzy because of turbulence in the atmosphere or perhaps because the telescope is performing poorly, then lower the magnification. Be careful to not over-magnify the object such that it overfills the field of view. This can cause a faint object to disappear.</p>

			<p>Here is a <b>table of magnification and aperture for objects of different size</b>. The aperture is based on a 7mm eye pupil. For 5mm eye pupil, increase magnification by 1.4 and decrease aperture by 1.4. Magnifications greater than 250x may be limited by seeing conditions.</p>

			<p><b>The strategy</b> is to select the highest magnification that frames the object in the eyepiece's field of view, subject to seeing conditions and telescope capabilities. Then select the largest aperture available. Starting with a given aperture, select for the highest magnification that frames the object, subject to seeing. If the object is invisible, then try a lower magnification. This rarely happens. Much more common is a failure to properly frame the object. Use filters, go to dark skies and improve your observational skills.</p>

			<p>Should you ever select for <b>less aperture</b>? That's equivalent to stopping down the aperture to improve the view. Stopping down by using an off-axis mask to reduce the deleterious effects of bad seeing helps. Stopping down to improve deep-sky views does not help. While objects can be detected at diminished apertures, there is a general loss of detail. See my results at <a href='Is Aperture King.html'>Is aperture king?</a></p>

			<p>As long as you can select for the largest aperture, you are in <b>telescope mode</b>. Once aperture is constrained, you are in <b>eyepiece mode</b>. Well-equipped amateurs who have a number of eyepieces should also consider equipping themselves with a range of apertures.</p>

			<p>Note that <b>wider angle eyepieces</b> allow for greater aperture.</p>

			<h4>Interpreting diagonal sizes</h4>

			<p>For the complete picture, the chart includes light lost from the diagonal obstruction. Larger diagonals improve off-axis illumination but cost light across the entire field.</p>

			<p>Use the magnitude scale; avoid percentages of illumination: the eye responds logarithmically, not linearly. It's a mistake to be upset over a 5% light loss when in fact from the eye's perspective the light loss is an imperceptible 1/20 magnitude.</p>

			<p>Coma correctors like barlow lenses are best thought of as eyepiece accessories. Just reduce the desired field size by the coma corrector or barlow's magnification factor. Ignore the change in the focal plane. For example, if the coma corrector magnifies 15% then reduce the desired field to illuminate by 15%. Vignetting is not an issue down to F2.6 for pupils 7mm and smaller.</p>

			<p>I find light loss of less than 0.3 magnitude hardly noticeable. For extended objects where both the background and object drop equally in magnitude, the contrast or ratio is unchanged, meaning that the eye's ability to detect the object remains largely unchanged. For instance, compare a 10 inch to a 12 inch telescope - the magnitude drop is 0.4. I can detect this difference when comparing views on borderline objects.  A drop of 0.5 magnitude or more is not readily detectable on brighter objects. However, the difference between a 10 inch and a 11 inch telescope is much smaller at 0.2 magnitudes and not readily apparent.</p>

			<p>An object's detectability depends on contrast between object and sky, apparent size of the object and the object's brightness. The contrast is the ratio between the object's brightness per area (typically one arc-second squared) added to the sky background brightness that is in front of the object and the sky background brightness adjacent to the object (contrast=(object+sky) / sky). When a star or extended object is dimmed as it approaches the edge of the field of view, so is the sky background. Contrast remains the same. Experiments that I have conducted show that the object's detectability is not diminished as much as the raw magnitude loss suggests. Besides, if critical detection is required, then the object can be brought to the center of the field. Read more on <a href='visual.html'>visual detection and limits at the eyepiece</a>.</p>

			<p>Diagonals act to degrade optical performance, the larger the diagonal, the worse the degradation. A one-third obstruction, a much larger ratio than the customary visual Newtonian uses, degrades the optical quality by about 1/14 wave RMS. Changes less than one-eight wave are very difficult to see. However, a smaller diagonal does not always result in improved views. <a href='The 1974 Telescope Secondary Experiment.html'>Check out my secondary size experiment</a>.</p>

			<p>The offset is the distance that the diagonal needs to be moved away from the focuser and the distance that the diagonal needs to be moved towards the primary mirror. For a detailed explanation including graphics, see <a href='DiagonalOffsetStudy/Telescope Newtonian Diagonal Offset Study.html'>my diagonal offset study</a>.</p>

			<h4>Optimizing diagonal size with tube diameter; optimizing for a coma corrector</h4>

			<p>In some cases a smaller tube diameter leads to a smaller diagonal with good light throughput and less weight. Allowing the coma corrector to intrude into the light path results in a smaller diagonal that obstructs less light than the coma corrector. <a href='TwoOptimizations.html'>Read my article on two unknown optimizations here</A>.</p>

		    <h4>Thoughts on an off-axis mask</h4>

		    <p>Stopping down by using an off-axis mask is a time honored way to beat seeing and to cut the dazzling light of the Moon and bright planets in large aperture scopes.</p>

			<p>Stopping down is less popular today. This could be so because of drifting preferences. It is also a testament to learning how to use large Dobsonian mirrors in the dropping night time air by cooling them with fans.</p>

			<p>The maximum diameter of an off-axis mask is set by taking the primary mirror's diameter and subtracting the diagonal's minor axis size then dividing the result by two. For example, a 16 inch with a 3.5 inch diagonal has a maximum off-axis mask diameter of (16 - 3.5) / 2 = 6.25 inches. If placed opposite any diagonal offset, the off-axis mask's diameter can be increased by the offset.</p>

			<p>The light throughput is the inverse of the mask diameter to primary mirror diameter squared. Using the numbers from above, (off-axis mask diameter / primary mirror diameter) squared is (6.25 / 16) ^2 = 0.15 or 15% light throughput. That dims the Moon's brightness by two magnitudes.</p>

			<p>When using an off-axis mask at lower powers, be sure to account for vignetting due to smaller sized diagonals that act to clip the off-axis aperture.</p>

			<p>Make a black cardboard mask with a one inch off-axis hole and aim at a bright star. The Airy disk and many rings look textbook beautiful. But that costs resolution. Of course this resolution is wasted at low magnification.</p>

			<p>What is the relationship between the off-axis mask's resolution and the telescope's magnification? What size should the off-axis mask be to resolve all that is possible at a particular magnification?</p>

			<p>Since the eye's entrance pupil at best resolution is 1mm in size, the eyepiece's exit pupil is the factor that the primary mirror's aperture can be reduced. For example, an exit pupil of 6mm (the exit pupil is calculated by taking the eyepiece's focal length in mm and dividing by the primary mirror's focal ratio) means that the off-axis mask should be 1/6 the diameter of the primary, an exit pupil of 3mm means that the off-axis mask should be 1/3 the diameter of the primary. This leads to the conclusion that the smallest exit pupil to use with the maximally sized off-axis mask is 2-3mm.</p>

			<p>There is also a very simple and easy to remember relationship between aperture and magnification with respect to resolution. And it is this: the telescope will resolve all that the human eye can see when the aperture in inches equals the magnification divided by 25. For example, at 100x, the off-axis mask should be at least 4 inches in diameter, 100 / 25 = 4.</p>

			<p>For the 16 incher's off-axis mask mentioned above, the optimal magnification is 6.25 * 25 = 156x.</p>

			<p>That's it! Now you can make those off-axis masks understanding the brightness reduction and the best fitting magnification (or what diameter to make the off-axis mask given a desired magnification).</p>

			<p>Note: double star observing with smaller apertures can double, even quadruple the optimum magnification, up to the seeing limit of the sky, in order to better see the Airy disk and rings.</p>
		</div>

		<div class='designer' id='designSpider'>
			<p>Babinet's principle states that diffracted light is proportional to the area obstructed, not the edges. And the length of the diffraction spike is inversely proportional to the spider vanes thickness. For example, if the spider vanes can be made half as thick then the total diffracted light is cut by half and the length of the spikes is increased, causing a further reduction in the brightness of the diffraction spikes.</p>

			<p>Today I use wire spiders because they are very thin. In fact, I only see small spikes in large apertures on the brightest stars. I find the refractor like views aesthetically satisfying. Wire spiders were popularized by Henry E. Paul in his "Telescopes for Skygazing", 1965. Today there is an explosion of creativity thanks to Larry Shaper, Mark Cowan, Jerry Oltion and others. The strength of the wires is dependent on gemetry and  independent of tension; consequently, I tighten the wires only to the point of avoiding sagging.</p>

			<p>If using a hub to hold the diagonal, orient the hub vertically. I measure a 3x reduction in laser collimator dot travel on the primary mirror compared to orienting the hub horizontally. Tom Otvos and Mark Cowan pointed this out to me. Luckily I oriented the 25" hub vertically; my previous scopes had the hub horizontally.</p>

			<p>You can see that I've also used single stalk spiders and 'V' spiders as appropriate. The diffraction pattern of a single stalk spider is not too ugly, considering the thickness of the stalk. There is room for invention here, combining a thinner single stalk with a couple of tensioned very thin wires. The diffraction pattern for a single stalk spider extends from the star like outstretched hands as a short thick tapered line of light turned 90 degrees to the stalk. Extending the stalk through to the opposite side of the tube increases diffraction.</p>

			<p>The 'V' spider produces two spikes, each at 90 degrees to a vane, each with less intensity than the single stalk spider.</p>

			<p>Future exploration includes thinner single stalk vane in combination with thin wires.</p>

			<h4>Designing wire spiders</h4>

			<p>It is important to wrap your arms around the fact that wire spiders gain their strength from geometry, not from tensioning. Increasing the tension on the wires does not make the wire spider stronger. The wires are tightened only to the point of not sagging.</p>

			<p>Every diagonal needs two support considerations:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Static: keep a consistent position so that optical alignment and focus do not change.
				<li>Dynamic: resist vibration caused by wind or bumps to the telescope. This manifests itself as a high magnification elongation to the stars with large heavy diagonals that disappears when the diagonal holder is touched.
			</ul>

			<p>Therefore wires need two geometries:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Cross wires such so that the tension force on the wires is reduced by taking advantage of geometry.
				<li>Arrange wires so that they do not cross in the center to reduce rotational quivering by heavier diagonals.
			</ul>
			<img alt='' src='wire spider illustrated.jpg'>

			<p>Since the diagonal is cantilevered, the spider can deform, misplacing the diagonal. One approach from decades ago is to add a small counterweight on a longer arm opposite the diagonal. This carries with it the downside that the diagonal can vibrate at a low frequency if energy is dumped into it.</p>

			<p>Finally, the upper end can deform causing the spider to twist.</p>

			<h4>Discussion</h4>

			<p>The cell designs presented here should be considered a starting point. I like to think of the mirror cell and the mirror working in concert to deliver a quality wavefront to the focal plane. In fact I do final figuring with the mirror in its cell.</p>

			<p>A telescope mirror sags between support points due to gravity bending and shearing. There are three approaches to calculating the necessary number of support points so that the bending and shearing of glass is insignificant at the focal plane. They are: 1) Hubble's equal area rule, 2) structural deformation calculations, and 3) finite element analysis. To a useful approximation, all three agree.</p>

			<p>For 3 point support, minimum bending before refocusing occurs at the 70% radius while after refocusing minimum bending occurs at the 40% radius. See <a href='https://www.davidlewistoronto.com/plop/'>David Lewis' discussion and further references to Luc Arnold and Richard Schwartz</a>. Texereau placed the support points just inside the edge to better position the mirror with respect to the edge supports. We can conclude that the radius can range from 40% to near 100% with but a slight degradation in the cell's ability to support the mirror.<br>
			For 6 point supports, the ring that the 6 points form is best placed at a radius of 57% according to PLOP. Six point designs are nearly as good as 9 points and have been popular from at least the 1960's. The support radius can vary from 50% to 71% without too much degradation. It is interesting that by turning a 3 point ring into 6 points, the optimal radius moves outward closer to an equal area inside and outside of the ring.<br>
			For 9 point supports, place the inner ring at the 33% radius and the outer ring at the 72% radius. If x is outer radius and y is inner radius then balance point = 2/3(cos(30)x-y) + y) = 2/3*cos(30)x + y/3 = 0.577x + y/3 = 52.6%<br>
			For 18 point supports, place the radii at 38% and 76%. If x is outer radius and y is inner radius then balance point = 2/3(cos(15)x-y) + y) = 2/3*cos(15)x + y/3 = 0.644x + y/3 = 61.6%. Using similar math as the 9 point support design, place the bar centers at the 53.4% radius.</p>

			<p>To further lessen the mirror's bending over individual support points, small triangles or circles of material sanded to fit the mirror's backside can be fitted to each support point. This can cut deformation that appears in the star test as coarse surface roughness.</p>

			<p>Most important is the quality of construction and the balance of the pieces.</p>

			<p>Edge supports are analyzed in R.N.Wilson's Reflecting Telescope Optics, Volume II. A simple edge support with points at exactly 90 degrees separation cancels primary astigmatism, fairing quite well. Each support point can be replaced with a 2-point whiffle tree in order to spread the load, lessening local deformation next to each support point. Slings are even better, though tough to build without side effects, whilst the best support is a ring of astatic levers where the lower levers support the mirror from bottom up and the upper levers pull up on the mirror's upper edge. Edge supports should be compliant so that they do not hold up the mirror as it settles into the cell as the telescope points upward.</p>

			<h4>Discussion</h4>

			<p>We want the 'good' light to reach our eye, the 'rogue' light to be blocked. Some rogue light we simply cannot block because it comes from the upper atmosphere exactly between the object and our telescope. This includes sky glow and reflected light pollution. Other rogue light strays into our eyes. This we can block with a hood over our head or by cupping the eyepiece with our hands. Remaining rogue light can sneak past the diagonal into the eyepiece and sneak past from behind the primary mirror, bouncing off the diagonal to fog the eyepiece.</p>

			<p>The rogue light sneaking past the diagonal can be blocked with a baffle. This baffle is called the projected focuser baffle or diagonal baffle. And rogue light sneaking past from behind the primary mirror can be blocked by baffles that surround the primary mirror. This baffle is called the primary mirror baffle. The baffle designer calculates the minimum size for these baffles based on geometric light ray traces. An additional baffle, not shown and not calculated, can be placed just below the focuser to tighten up the projected focuser or diagonal baffle.</p>

			<p>Using an idea by Larry Shaper in Amateur Astronomy magazine, Issue #91, Summer 2016, page 52-53, the edges of the baffle can be tilted to direct light away from the focuser's tube bottom aperture. Larry concludes that the flattest black paint always looks gray while a baffle painted in gloss black with tilted sides looks truly black. You can see that the tilt angles light past the focuser tube and is long enough that light reflected at a narrow angle face on is also directed away from the focuser tube. Since the optical tube assembly can be open, I tilt the projected focuser baffle on both sides.</p>

			<h4>Lowrider discussion</h4>

			<p>By increasing the diagonal's angle, we can aim move the focuser a little closer to the primary mirror, lessening the eyepiece's height above the ground.</p>

			<p>Why a folded reflector (popular name, 'low rider')? It's all about convenience: the eyepiece height above ground is shortened. This can make the difference between ladder and no ladder or between high up a ladder and stepping up onto a stool.</p>

			<p>An early example of a folded (or low rider) reflector is Ed Danilovicz's 12 inch, featured in Sky and Telescope magazine, April 1976 pg 278.</p>

			<h4>Center of gravity discussion</h4>

			<p>I like to use the mirror's forward edge to reference distances. So the mirror cell has a negative distance and the diagonal, focuser and eyepiece are at the mirror's focal length minus the diagonal to focal plane distance minus the sagitta.</p>

			<p>To arrive at the tube clearance needed for the Dobsonian rocker be sure to set the tube's OD.</p>

			<p>With today's heavy eyepieces and coma correctors, it is important to vertically offset the Center of Gravity to maintain balance as the scope swings upward.</p>

			<h4>Friction of movement discussion</h4>

			<p>An essential feature of John Dobson's telescope design is that the telescope moves smoothly and precisely about the sky, staying put once the operator let's go. There is no clamping or locking down. Tracking an object across the sky consists of periodic adjustments by pushing the scope very small distances while looking through the eyepiece. His design depends on an interesting property of Teflon on pebbly Formica, namely that the friction felt when moving the scope is about the same as the friction felt while starting the move. In other words, the dynamic friction equals static friction. Most materials stick worse than they move, leading to jerky motions.</p>

			<p>The force to move the telescope should not be so great as to demand a great deal of effort, particularly when making very tiny high magnification adjustments by hand, nor should the force be so slight that wind can move the telescope. Ideally the force in both azimuth and altitude axes is roughly the same so that the axes 'disappear' as the scope is moved to and fro.</p>

			<p>The force to move the scope in azimuth increases as the scope is pointed upward. I set the angle at 48 degrees or halfway up the sky. This is the optimum pointing angle given the range of altitude movement, area of sky and seeing conditions. Keep in mind that as the scope is pointed further upward that the azimuth resistance to movement becomes quite stiff.</p>

			<p>I like a frictional force of two to three pounds (1 to 1.5 kilos); others prefer less friction. This gives me a smooth and not-too-stiff touch at the upper end of the scope, avoids balancing issues with heavy eyepieces and resists weathervaning from wind gusts.</p>

			<p>The altitude friction can be adjusted by varying the bearing angle and the altitude bearing radius. The azimuth friction can be adjusted by varying the distance from the pads to the pivot (the azimuth bearing radius) and by changing the material pairing. Bearings can be substituted for one or more of the bearing points with a proportionate reduction in friction. For instance, the azimuth friction can be reduced by two-thirds if two of the three bearing pads are replaced with roller bearings. More unusual is to build a trolley with a pad on one end and a roller bearing on the other end. By moving the pivot location closer to the pad the friction can be increased and by moving the pivot location closer to the bearing the friction can be decreased.</p>

			<p>The formula and concept is from Richard Berry's article in Telescope Making 8, page 36-.</p>

			<p>The size of the pads modestly affects the quality of motion. It's a long standing rule of thumb that 15 PSI (pounds per square inch) is ideal.</p>

			<p>The key here is to have a favorable static to dynamic friction ratio where the friction to begin the movement is less than the friction to continue the movement. This feels like 'butter' at the eyepiece.</p>

			<p>Imagine the altitude bearing getting bigger and bigger. The rocker's weight shrinks, which is good but so does the height, lessening its rigidity, which is bad. But what if the altitude bearing points are placed at the rocker's corners and under each corner an azimuth bearing is placed resulting in four azimuth bearings that ride on a rigid ring? In fact, the altitude and azimuth bearings can be combined into a single block with the rocker reduced to merely holding the bearing blocks in relative position. We can have our ultralight rocker with good rigidity. Additionally, the mirror box can swing down through the base to lower eyepiece height when pointing near the zenith. <a href='FlexRocker/FlexRockers.html'>Check out some examples.</a></p>

			<h4>Equatorial table discussion...</h4>

			<p>The polar axis must pass through the combined center of gravity of the tube assembly, rocker and the equatorial table's platform.</p>
			<p>Values for a four corner equatorial table are calculated where a tracking arc is situated at each corner of the equatorial table.</p>
			<p>Other table designs include three arcs (two on the north side of the platform, one on the south side), two arcs on the north side and a pivot on the south side, and finally, two pivots, one on the north side and one on the south side.</p>
