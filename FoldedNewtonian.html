An early example of a folded (or bent) Newtonian is Ed Danilovicz's 12 inch, featured in Sky and Telescope magazine, April 1976 pg 278.<br>
Ross Robert's folded 16 inch was featured in the Oregon Star Party Walkabout of 2008 here <a href="http://www.bbastrodesigns.com/osp08/RossRoberts-16.jpg">http://www.bbastrodesigns.com/osp08/RossRoberts-16.jpg</a><br>
Dan Gray's bent 28 inch is a popular scope at the Oregon Star Party. The eyepiece is a couple of feet closer to the ground because of the folded design. <a href="http://www.siderealtechnology.com/28inch/">http://www.siderealtechnology.com/28inch/</a><br>
Pete's 25 inch folded scope as posted on the atm-free discussion group, from 2006. He's since added side panels and a tertiary mirror to angle the eyepiece directly outward.<br>

You can search on 'low rider telescope', one recent name for this design, to find more examples.<br>
<br>
Why a folded Newt? It's all about convenience: the eyepiece height above ground is shortened. This can make the difference between ladder and no ladder or between high up a ladder and stepping up onto a stool.<br>
Why the tiertiary design? First of all, if you want to 'turn off' the tiertiary, then set the tiertary distance to zero. Here's why I favor adding the third mirror. I am distracted by the fear of a very expensive eyepiece undergoing an impact test against the ground to the point I can't concentrate on observing. When the scope is pointed near the zenith, the heavy eyepiece ends up pointed in a downward direction. I'm constantly overtightening the focuser's setscrew that holds the eyepiece in fear of the eyepiece sliding out. Also, my neck ends up kinked. It's not a joyful observing experience.<br>
